Each plan comes with a set number of workflow execution hours and in the paid plans you can add as many additional execution hours you need. When a workflow runs, the time it takes to actually execute is deduced from your hours credit. \n\n\n\n\nFor example with free tier's 3 hours workflow execution credit, if your workflow on average takes 2 seconds to execute, then in the free tier you get:\n\n\n\n\n3 hours in seconds / 2 seconds  = 5400 workflow executions\n\n\n\n\nThe number of workflow executions therefore depends on the type of workflow you build and how long it takes for each execution takes to process.\n\n\n\n\nWe don‚Äôt count the executions in your monthly package, but rather the time it takes to process each execution.\n\n\n\n\nThis results in a highly robust and scalable workflow solution which lets you scale infinitely as your product grows. You can easily add more execution hours in any paid plan if you exceed the available processing time that month.\n\nProject and Users\n\nWhen you sign up for BuildShip, you get a free project by default. Upgrading your project allows you to unlock paid features as per the tier. The cost is on a per-project basis. You can think of a project similar to a workspace. Thus, the users you invite to a project can only access that project workspace and workflows. Creation of any project beyond the free one requires a subscription to a paid plan.\n\nWhat is a AI generated node?\n\nYou can use any of the pre generated nodes from the node explorer. However, if you want to connect to anything not listed and want to use the help of AI to generate a node for you by simply describing the logic you want to be created, then you can use the AI generated node. \n\nIf you have exhausted your quota of AI generated nodes in paid plans, then you can add-on additional credits for AI nodes.\n\nWhat are the different support channels for free and paid users?\n\nIn the initial beta phase, we will be providing support to all users via in app support form\n\nHowever, after the beta phase, we will be able to provide support for paid plans only via the in app support forms and for the free plan support will be made available from within the community on Discord and by the team on a best effort basis.

Each plan comes with a set number of workflow execution hours and in the paid plans you can add as many additional execution hours you need. When a workflow runs, the time it takes to actually execute is deduced from your hours credit. \n\n\n\n\nFor example with free tier's 3 hours workflow execution credit, if your workflow on average takes 2 seconds to execute, then in the free tier you get:\n\n\n\n\n3 hours in seconds / 2 seconds  = 5400 workflow executions\n\n\n\n\nThe number of workflow executions therefore depends on the type of workflow you build and how long it takes for each execution takes to process.\n\n\n\n\nWe don‚Äôt count the executions in your monthly package, but rather the time it takes to process each execution.\n\n\n\n\nThis results in a highly robust and scalable workflow solution which lets you scale infinitely as your product grows. You can easily add more execution hours in any paid plan if you exceed the available processing time that month.\n\nProject and Users\n\nWhen you sign up for BuildShip, you get a free project by default. Upgrading your project allows you to unlock paid features as per the tier. The cost is on a per-project basis. You can think of a project similar to a workspace. Thus, the users you invite to a project can only access that project workspace and workflows. Creation of any project beyond the free one requires a subscription to a paid plan.\n\nWhat is a AI generated node?\n\nYou can use any of the pre generated nodes from the node explorer. However, if you want to connect to anything not listed and want to use the help of AI to generate a node for you by simply describing the logic you want to be created, then you can use the AI generated node. \n\nIf you have exhausted your quota of AI generated nodes in paid plans, then you can add-on additional credits for AI nodes.\n\nWhat are the different support channels for free and paid users?\n\nIn the initial beta phase, we will be providing support to all users via in app support form\n\nHowever, after the beta phase, we will be able to provide support for paid plans only via the in app support forms and for the free plan support will be made available from within the community on Discord and by the team on a best effort basis. No response time guaranteed. Upgrade to paid plans for guaranteed support time.\n\nWhat is a cold start?\n\nIn the free and starter plans, a cold start occurs.

Each plan comes with a set number of workflow execution hours and in the paid plans you can add as many additional execution hours you need. When a workflow runs, the time it takes to actually execute is deduced from your hours credit. \n\n\n\n\nFor example with free tier's 3 hours workflow execution credit, if your workflow on average takes 2 seconds to execute, then in the free tier you get:\n\n\n\n\n3 hours in seconds / 2 seconds  = 5400 workflow executions\n\n\n\n\nThe number of workflow executions therefore depends on the type of workflow you build and how long it takes for each execution takes to process.\n\n\n\n\nWe don‚Äôt count the executions in your monthly package, but rather the time it takes to process each execution.\n\n\n\n\nThis results in a highly robust and scalable workflow solution which lets you scale infinitely as your product grows. You can easily add more execution hours in any paid plan if you exceed the available processing time that month.\n\nProject and Users\n\nWhen you sign up for BuildShip, you get a free project by default. Upgrading your project allows you to unlock paid features as per the tier. The cost is on a per-project basis. You can think of a project similar to a workspace. Thus, the users you invite to a project can only access that project workspace and workflows. Creation of any project beyond the free one requires a subscription to a paid plan.\n\nWhat is a AI generated node?\n\nYou can use any of the pre generated nodes from the node explorer. However, if you want to connect to anything not listed and want to use the help of AI to generate a node for you by simply describing the logic you want to be created, then you can use the AI generated node. \n\nIf you have exhausted your quota of AI generated nodes in paid plans, then you can add-on additional credits for AI nodes.\n\nWhat are the different support channels for free and paid users?\n\nIn the initial beta phase, we will be providing support to all users via in app support form\n\nHowever, after the beta phase, we will be able to provide support for paid plans only via the in app support forms and for the free plan support will be made available from within the community on Discord and by the team on a best effort basis. No response time guaranteed. Upgrade to paid plans for guaranteed support time.\n\nWhat is a cold start?\n\nIn the free and starter plans, a cold start occurs. This means that if you're making your first API request or a request after a significant break since the last one, the response time will be longer than for immediate, consecutive requests. Keep this in mind when estimating the duration of your workflow run.\n\nHow to reach the BuildShip team?\n\nOur preferred method is for you to reach out to us via the Support form on the BuildShip app. Alternatively you can email us at hello@buildship.com\nFAQs\nFAQs\nFAQs\nWhat does workflow execution hours mean and how many workflow executions can you have per hour? *\n\nWorkflow execution refer to one run of a workflow i.e. one API call or one function run.

If any integration is missing, don't get stuck - use AI to generate your own workflow nodes. BuildShip gives you the best of no-code with the power of low-code. See the 5-minute product walkthrough.\n\n\n\nQuick Start\n\nFollow the learning resources below to get a deeper understanding of the platform:\n\nHow to build a workflow?\n‚Üí\nWhat is a node?\n‚Üí\nWhat are workflow triggers?\n‚Üí\n\nYou can connect your favorite AI models, tools, API services, and backend in minutes. Extend your workflow's capabilities with JavaScript / TypeScript code and 1M+ NPM packages! ü§Ø\n\nBuildShip lets you build scalable backend workflows for the apps you build on any stack. Be it a no-code app builder (FlutterFlow, Webflow, Framer, Adalo, Bubble, BravoStudio ...) or a frontend framework (Next.js, React, Vue ...) - you can build scalable backend tasks for them in minutes. This means you don't need to wrangle or deploy things on the cloud platform, wait for long build cycles of cloud functions, perform DevOps, etc.\n\nNo-code friendly but the code of every node is accessible and tweakable in javascript/typescript. Comes with features like instant deployment (no need to wait for long build cycles), version control, multiple projects, copying workflows from one project to another, a large number of templates on popular use cases - WhatsApp Bot, Google Vision, Stripe Payment, and so much more.\n\n‚ú®‚ú® Just Build and Ship, instantly üöÄ\n\nWhat's inside? üëÄ\n\nBuilt on top of powerful and scalable Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BuildShip gives you a friction-free serverless development experience.
