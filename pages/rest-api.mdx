Nextra was initially created by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) members
[Shu Ding](https://twitter.com/shuding_) and
[Paco Coursey](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey) in 2020. Since 2021,
[Yixuan Xu](https://twitter.com/yixuanxu94) contributed tremendously to the
project. In 2022, [Dimitri Postolov](https://twitter.com/B2o5T) from
[The Guild](https://the-guild.dev) joined the core team to help with the
development of 2.0.
