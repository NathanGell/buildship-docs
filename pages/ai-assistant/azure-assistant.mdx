### 3. Resource

The name of your Azure resource.

### 4. User Prompt

This input field is where you enter the prompt or query that you want to send to the AI assistant. This represents the
incoming message from the user or client.

### 5. Thread ID

This optional input allows you to save and share the context of the conversation using a thread ID. The thread ID can be
any unique identifier, such as a UUID or a custom string. The chat history belonging to a specific thread ID is
retrieved and continued in subsequent interactions. If no thread ID is provided, a new conversation thread is started,
and a new thread ID is generated automatically.

### 6. Instructions

You can use this input to override the default system message or instructions for the AI assistant. This is useful for
modifying the assistant's behavior or persona on a per-run basis.
