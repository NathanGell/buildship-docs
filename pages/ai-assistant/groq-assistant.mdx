# Groq Assistant

The **Groq AI Assistant Node** is a powerful tool that allows you to create and interact with an AI-powered
conversational assistant. It leverages the capabilities of the Groq platform, which provides access to large language
models and natural language processing capabilities.

## Setting Up the Groq Assistant

<Steps>

### Step 1: Adding the Groq Assistant Node

In your BuildShip Workflow canvas, click on the **+ Add Node** button. In the search bar, type **Groq AI Assistant** and
click on the node to add it to your canvas.

### Step 2: Adding the Groq API Key

The Groq AI Assistant Node requires an API key to connect to the Groq platform. You can obtain an API key by signing up
on the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys). Once you have the API key, paste it into the **API Key** field in
the Groq AI Assistant Node settings.

<Callout>
  **RECOMMENDED:** Use BuildShip Secrets to securely store your API key and re-use it across multiple workflows. [Learn

### Step 3: Add in the Instructions

You can now configure the Groq AI Assistant Node by adding in the instructions that you want the assistant to follow.
This is like a System Prompt for the Groq AI Assistant to set a context for the conversation.

**For Example:**
`You are a helpful travel assistant providing recommendations for vacation destinations based on the user's preferences.`

### Step 4: Passing the User Prompt

The User Prompt is the input that the user provides to the assistant. You can pass in the User Prompt from the body of
the incoming request to the workflow. The Groq AI Assistant Node will use this input, along with the Instructions to
generate a response.

**For Example:**
`I'm planning a family vacation next summer. We enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and camping, and we'd like to go somewhere with beautiful scenery and moderate temperatures. Can you suggest some good destinations for us?`

You can pass in the User Prompt from the body of the incoming request as follows:

### Step 5: Configure the Tokens and Model

Optionally, users can set the maximum number of tokens (units of text) that the AI assistant's response can contain. The
default value is `1024`.

Select the specific language model to be used by the AI assistant. The available options are `LLaMA3 70b`, `LLaMA3 8b`,
`Mixtral 8x7b`, and `Gemma 7b`. The default model is `LLaMA3 8b`.

### Step 6: Thread ID

Optionally, provide a thread ID to maintain the conversation history between the user and the AI assistant. If provided,
the node will retrieve the previous messages from the specified thread and include them in the context for the current
response. [Learn more on how the Assistant maintains the conversation history]().

</Steps>

## Chat History

The Groq Assistants, like all other assistants, maintains the chat history by storing the conversation messages in your
BuildShip Storage associated with your project. If a threadId is provided, the node will attempt to load the previous
messages from the corresponding history. If the history does not exist, a new conversation thread is started. After each
response from the AI assistant, the node appends the latest messages to the chat history, ensuring that the conversation
history is preserved for future interactions.

## Outputs

The Groq AI Assistant Node returns the following outputs:

- **Message**: The response generated by the AI assistant based on the User Prompt and Instructions.
- **Thread ID**: The unique identifier for the conversation thread. This can be used to maintain the conversation
  history between the user and the AI assistant.
- **Data**: The complete response object from the Groq API, which includes additional metadata and information about the
  AI assistant's response.
