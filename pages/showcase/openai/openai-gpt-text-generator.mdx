# Text Generator
The Text Generator node uses the OpenAI GPT API to generate text based on both a system prompt and a user prompt. This allows for highly customizable and contextually relevant text generation, suitable for various applications like chatbots, content creation, and more.

<Node id="@buildship/openai-gpt-text-generator" version="1.1.2" />
