# Text Generator

The **Text Generator** node uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate text based on provided system and user prompts. You can customize the behavior and tone of the text output by setting relevant parameters.

<Node id="@buildship/openai-gpt-text-generator" version="1.1.3" />

## Inputs

To use the Text Generator node, you need to provide the following inputs:

1. **API Key**: Your OpenAI API Key, which you can get from your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. **System Prompt**: This prompt sets the behavior and tone for your text generation. For example, `"You are a helpful assistant."`.
3. **User Prompt**: The prompt from the user for generating the text. For example, `"What is the capital of France?"`.
4. **Model**: Select the OpenAI model to be used for text generation. Available models include:
    - `gpt-4o`
    - `gpt-4`
    - `gpt-3.5-turbo`
    - `gpt-4-1106-preview`
5. **Max Tokens**: Maximum length (in tokens) of the generated text. The default is 600.
6. **Temperature**: A number between 0 and 1 that dictates the randomness of the output. Lower values produce more deterministic outputs, while higher values produce more random outputs. The default is 0.5.

### Sample Inputs

- **API Key**: `"your-openai-api-key"`
- **System Prompt**: `You are a helpful assistant.`
- **User Prompt**: `What is the capital of France?`
- **Model**: `gpt-4`
- **Max Tokens**: `100`
- **Temperature**: `0.7`

## Output

The output of this node is a string that contains the text generated by the OpenAI GPT model based on the given prompts.

- **Generated Text**: The text generated by the OpenAI GPT API. For example, `"The capital of France is Paris."`

This node is a powerful tool for generating human-like text based on customizable parameters, making it suitable for various applications like chatbots, content generation, and more.
