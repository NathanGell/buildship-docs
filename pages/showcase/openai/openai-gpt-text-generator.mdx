# Text Generator
The Text Generator node uses the OpenAI GPT API to generate text based on given user and system prompts. By leveraging advanced models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and others, it produces coherent and contextually relevant text outputs tailored to your specific requirements.

<Node id="@buildship/openai-gpt-text-generator" version="1.1.1" />

## Inputs
To use the Text Generator node effectively, you need to provide the following inputs:

- **API Key**: The OpenAI API Key. [Get your API Key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
  - **Sample Input**: "sk-****"

- **System Prompt**: The system prompt that sets the context or guidelines for the generated text.
  - **Sample Input**: "You are an AI assistant that generates creative writing pieces."

- **User Prompt**: The user-specific prompt for which the text is generated.
  - **Sample Input**: "Write a short story about a dragon who discovers a new world."

- **Max Tokens**: The maximum length (in tokens) of the generated text. Defaults to 600.
  - **Sample Input**: 500

- **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of the generated text. Higher values (closer to 1) make the output more random, while lower values (closer to 0) make it more deterministic. Defaults to 0.5.
  - **Sample Input**: 0.7

- **Model**: The OpenAI model to use for text generation. The available options are:
  - `gpt-4o`
  - `gpt-4`
  - `gpt-3.5-turbo`
  - `gpt-4-1106-preview`
  - **Sample Input**: "gpt-4"

## Output
The node returns the generated text based on the provided inputs:

- **Generated Text**: The text generated by the OpenAI GPT API.
  - **Example Output**: 
    ```
    Once upon a time in a land far beyond the known realms, there was a dragon who discovered a world untouched by magic...
    ```
