# OpenAI Assistant (Stream Response)
Add different script nodes and let the AI Assistant automatically choose which to execute based on the input. The node returns a streamed text response (meant to be returned back to the client) and the thread ID (to track the conversation). Built to work with OpenAI Assistants API.

<Node id="@buildship/openai-assistant-node-stream-response" version="2.1.1" />

## Inputs
This node requires the following inputs to function:

- **API Key**: (`string`) - The OpenAI API key to use for authentication.
- **Assistant ID**: (`string`) - The ID of the assistant to use. You need to create the assistant in the OpenAI console.
- **User Prompt**: (`string`) - The prompt to send to the assistant as a user message.
- **Thread ID**: (`string`, optional) - The ID of the conversation thread to use. If not specified, a new thread will be created.
- **Instructions**: (`string`, optional) - Override the default system message of the assistant. Useful for modifying behavior on a per-run basis.
- **Built-in Tools**: (`array`, optional) - Select the OpenAI assistant built-in tools to use.

### Sample Inputs
```json
{
  "apiKey": "your-openai-api-key",
  "assistantId": "assistant-id-from-console",
  "prompt": "How's the weather today?",
  "threadId": "existing-thread-id",
  "instructions": "Provide a detailed weather report",
  "builtInTools": ["file_search", "code_interpreter"]
}
```

## Output
The node returns an object containing the following properties:

- **Thread ID**: (`string`) - The thread ID of the active Assistant thread. Useful for tracking the conversation.
- **Response Stream**: (`object`) - The streamed response generated by the Assistant. This can be returned to the client in the form of a stream to receive the data in real-time.

The Assistant Response object encapsulates these components to facilitate seamless conversation tracking and data streaming.

  "threadId": "current-thread-id",
