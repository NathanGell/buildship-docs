# OpenAI Assistant (Stream Response)
Add different script nodes and let the AI Assistant automatically choose which to execute based on the input. The node returns a streamed text response (meant to be returned back to the client) and the thread ID (to track the conversation). Built to work with OpenAI Assistants API.

<Node id="@buildship/openai-assistant-node-stream-response" version="2.1.2" />

## Inputs
To use this node, you need to provide the following inputs:

1. **API Key**: *(Required)* The OpenAI API key to use for authentication.
2. **Assistant ID**: *(Required)* The ID of the assistant to use. You need to create the assistant in the OpenAI console.
3. **User Prompt**: *(Required)* The prompt to send to the assistant as a user message.
4. **Thread ID**: *(Optional)* The ID of the conversation thread to use. If not specified, a new thread will be created.
5. **Instructions**: *(Optional)* Override the default system message of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.
6. **Built-in Tools**: *(Optional)* Select the OpenAI assistant built-in tools to use. Available options are `file_search` and `code_interpreter`.

### Sample Inputs
```json
{
  "apiKey": "your-openai-api-key",
  "assistantId": "your-assistant-id",
  "prompt": "How is the weather today?",
  "threadId": "optional-thread-id",
  "instructions": "optional-instructions-to-override-default-behavior",
  "builtInTools": ["file_search", "code_interpreter"]
}
```

## Output
The node returns an object containing the following:

- **Response Stream**: The streamed response generated by the Assistant. Meant to be returned via the 'Return' node to allow the client to receive the response in the form of a stream.
- **Thread ID**: The thread ID of the active Assistant thread, which can be used separately, such as setting it as a response header for the client to receive and store during the conversation.

### Sample Output
```json
{
  "stream": "response-stream-object",
  "threadId": "thread-id"
}
```
