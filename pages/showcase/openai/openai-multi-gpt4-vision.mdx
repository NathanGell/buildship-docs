# Multi-Image GPT-4 Vision
The **Multi-Image GPT-4 Vision** node analyzes multiple images using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model. This node takes in a set of image URLs and accompanying text description or questions, then processes them through the specified GPT-4 model to generate a detailed analysis or answer.

<Node id="@buildship/openai-multi-gpt4-vision" version="1.1.1" />

## Inputs
The **Multi-Image GPT-4 Vision** node requires the following inputs:

- **API Key**: The OpenAI API Key. Obtain it [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). *(String, Required)*
- **Image URLs**: An array of URLs pointing to the images to be analyzed. *(Array, Required)*
- **Max Tokens**: The maximum number of tokens that the model should generate. *(Number, Default: 300, Required)*
- **Model**: The specific OpenAI vision model to use, which can be `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4o`, or `gpt-4o-mini`. *(String, Required)*
- **Question**: The text description or question about the images. *(String, Required)*

### Sample Input
Here is a sample input for the node:

- **API Key**: `sk...YourOpenAIKey`
- **Image URLs**: `["https://example.com/image1.jpg", "https://example.com/image2.jpg"]`
- **Max Tokens**: `300`
- **Model**: `gpt-4o`
- **Question**: `What are the main objects found in these images?`

## Output
The **Multi-Image GPT-4 Vision** node returns a detailed response from the GPT-4 Vision model based on the given inputs. The response will be a structured object containing the analysis or answer generated by the model.

### Example Output
The output might look something like this:

```json
{
  "text": "The first image contains a dog playing with a ball, while the second image shows a sunset over a mountain."
}
```

This response provides insights or answers to the question posed about the provided images, based on the capabilities and analysis of the selected GPT-4 Vision model.
