# GPT-4 Vision
GPT-4 Vision is a powerful tool that allows you to ask questions about images using OpenAI's advanced GPT-4 model. By providing an image and a question, the model can generate informative and detailed responses based on the visual content of the image.

<Node id="@buildship/openai-vision" version="1.1.2" />

## Inputs
To use the GPT-4 Vision node, you'll need to provide the following inputs:

1. **API Key** (`string`): Your OpenAI API key, which you can obtain [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. **Question** (`string`): The question you want to ask about the provided image.
3. **Image URL** (`string`): The URL of the image youâ€™re questioning. Base64 encoded images are also supported.
4. **Max Tokens** (`number`): The maximum number of tokens for the generated response. Default is set to 300.
5. **Model** (`string`): The model type to use for the GPT-4 Vision. Options include:
    - `gpt-4o`
    - `gpt-4-turbo`
    - `gpt-4-vision-preview`
    - `gpt-4o-mini`
6. **Detail** (`string`): The level of detail to process in the image and generate the response. Options are:
    - `auto`
    - `low`
    - `high`

### Sample Input
```json
{
  "apiKey": "your-openai-api-key",
  "input": "What is happening in this image?",
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "maxTokens": 300,
  "model": "gpt-4-vision-preview",
  "detail": "auto"
}
```

## Output
The output will be a string containing the model's response to the question based on the image provided. This textual response will aim to provide a comprehensive answer to your question.

### Example Output
```text
The image shows a group of people playing soccer in a park. It seems to be a sunny day, and everyone appears to be enjoying the game.
