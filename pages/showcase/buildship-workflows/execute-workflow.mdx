# Execute Workflow
The **Execute Workflow** node is designed to trigger and execute a BuildShip Workflow using the `BuildShip Trigger` on the target workflow. This node allows you to programmatically start workflows, optionally waiting for their completion, and can pass specific data to the workflow being triggered.

<Node id="@buildship/execute-workflow" version="1.5.0" />

## Inputs
### Workflow ID
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The ID of the workflow to call. You can get the Workflow ID from the `BuildShip Trigger` config.
- **Example**: `exampleWorkflowId`

### Await?
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Description**: Whether you wish to wait for the triggered workflow to execute.
- **Default**: `true`
- **Example**: `true`

### Data
- **Type**: `object`
- **Description**: The data to be passed to another workflow as the body.
- **Default**: `{}`
- **Example**: `{ "key": "value" }`

### Project ID
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: **(OPTIONAL)** If you wish to execute a BuildShip Workflow that's not a part of the same project, you'd need to specify the Project ID. You can find the **Project ID** in the BuildShip Project Settings or from the `BuildShip Trigger` config.
- **Default**: `""`
- **Example**: `exampleProjectId`

## Output
The output of the **Execute Workflow** node varies based on whether the `await` input is set to true or false.

- If `await` is set to `true`, the output will include the response data from the triggered workflow.
    ```json
    {
        "success": true,
        "response": {
            // response data from the triggered workflow
        }
    }
    ```

- If `await` is set to `false`, the output will simply confirm that the workflow was successfully triggered, without waiting for its completion.
    ```json
    {
        "success": true
    }
    ```
