# Create Post
This node allows you to create a new post on a WordPress site. By providing the necessary credentials and post details, the node communicates with the WordPress site's REST API to create the post.

<Node id="@buildship/wordpress-create-post" version="1.1.0" />

## Inputs
To use this node, you need to supply the following inputs:

- **Site URL**: The base URL of your WordPress site.
  
  Example: `https://example.com`

- **Username**: Your login username for the WordPress site.
  
  Example: `admin`

- **Password**: Your application password. See [instructions](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/05/application-passwords-integration-guide) for creating a new one.
  
- **Title**: The title of the post you want to create.
  
  Example: `My First Post`

- **Content**: The body content of the post.
  
  Example: `This is the content of my first post.`

- **Status**: The status of the post which can be either `draft` or `publish`. Default is `draft`.
  
  Example: `publish`

## Output
The node returns the created post's data in JSON format. If the post creation is successful, you will receive a response containing details of the newly created post. In case of an error, an error message will be logged and thrown.

Example output:
```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "date": "2023-10-09T12:34:56",
  "title": {
    "rendered": "My First Post"

  "content": {
    "rendered": "<p>This is the content of my first post.</p>"
  },
  "status": "publish",
  "link": "https://example.com/my-first-post/"
