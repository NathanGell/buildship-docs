# Rename GCP Folder
This function allows you to rename a folder within a Google Cloud Storage bucket. If the folder exists, it will be renamed to the specified new name.

<Node id="@buildship/gcp-storage-folder-rename" version="1.2.0" />

## Inputs
To use this node, you need to provide the following inputs:

- **Bucket ID**: The ID of the GCP Storage bucket. You can get your GCP Bucket ID and add Service Account Permissions as described in our [detailed setup blog](https://docs.buildship.com/tutorials/gcp-storage#access-buildship-settings).
  - **Example**: process.env.BUCKET

- **Old Folder Name**: The current name of the folder you wish to rename. If the folder is in the root directory, directly write the name (e.g., *folder-name*).
  - **Example**: folder-name

- **New Folder Name**: The new name for the folder. For example, to migrate a folder named *folder-name* inside a *public* folder and rename it as *assets*, you would input: `public/assets`.
  - **Example**: public/assets

## Output
The node will return a string indicating the status of the rename operation.

- **Status**: A confirmation message indicating the success or failure of the operation.
  - **Example**: "Folder successfully renamed!"
