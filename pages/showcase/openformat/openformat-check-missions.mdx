# Check Missions
The "Check Missions" node checks whether a user has completed all of the actions that constitute a mission and determines if the user has been rewarded for completing the mission.

<Node id="@buildship/openformat-check-missions" version="1.1.0" />

## Inputs

  *Example input:* `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
  
- **Missions**: An array of missions, each containing the required actions and rewards for that mission. Detailed structure for missions can be found [here](https://docs.openformat.tech/no-code/buildship/nodes/check-missions).
  
  *Example input:* `[{"name": "Mission1", "requirements": [{"action_name": "action1", "count": 3}], "xp_reward_amount": 100, "badge_reward_id": "badge1"}]`
  
- **dApp ID**: The ID for your OPENFORMAT dApp. You can create and find your dApp ID from the [OPENFORMAT dashboard](https://app.openformat.tech/).
  
  *Example input:* `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`
  
- **User ID**: The account address of the user whose information you want to retrieve (e.g., `0xeed12ae3b7cc78ea09ba4cc6e34a997b969ea8e6`).
  
  *Example input:* `0xeed12ae3b7cc78ea09ba4cc6e34a997b969ea8e6`

## Output
The output of this node provides the following details:

- **completedMissions**: An array of mission names that the user has completed.

  ```json
  {
    "completedMissions": ["Mission1", "Mission2"]
  }
  ```
  
- **pendingMissions**: An array of newly completed missions by the user including reward details like `xp_reward_amount` and `badge_reward_id`.

  ```json
  {
    "pendingMissions": [
      {"name": "Mission3", "xp_reward_amount": 200, "badge_reward_id": "badge2"}
    ]
  }
  ```
  
- **uncompletedMissions**: An array of missions that are still in progress, including progress information with percentage and remaining actions.

  ```json
  {
    "uncompletedMissions": [
      {
        "name": "Mission4",
        "progressInPercent": "50.0",
        "remainingActions": [{"name": "action2", "remainingCount": 1}]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

This node ensures that you can effectively track user progress on missions, identify completed missions for reward distribution, and pinpoint actions still required to fully complete missions.
