# LLM Extract
The **LLM Extract** node is designed to extract structured data from any web page. Leveraging Anthropic's AI capabilities, this node can pull out specific fields from the content of a given URL, making it incredibly useful for web scraping and data extraction tasks.

<Node id="@buildship/anthropic-extract" version="2.1.0" />

## Inputs
To use the **LLM Extract** node, you need to provide several inputs:

1. **Mode**: This determines the extraction method. You can choose between `text` and `html`. The `Text` mode provides a concise context but omits web page semantics like URLs, while the `HTML` mode preserves HTML semantics.
   - **Example**: `"mode": "html"`

2. **API Key**: Your Anthropic API key, which you can obtain from the [Anthropic Dashboard](https://console.anthropic.com/).
   - **Example**: `"apiKey": "your-anthropic-api-key"`

3. **Selector**: An optional HTML selector to specify which part of the page to extract. If left empty, the entire body will be used.
   - **Example**: `"selector": "div.content"`

4. **Fields**: A comma-separated list of field names you want to extract.
   - **Example**: `"fields": "title, price, description"`

5. **URL**: The URL of the web page from which you want to extract information.
   - **Example**: `"url": "https://example.com/product-page"`

### Sample Input
```json
{
  "mode": "html",
  "apiKey": "your-anthropic-api-key",
  "selector": "div.content",
  "fields": "title, price, description",
  "url": "https://example.com/product-page"
}
```

## Output
The **LLM Extract** node returns an array of objects containing the extracted fields. Each object corresponds to a specific entity found on the web page, with the fields populated as specified in the input.

### Example Output
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Example Product",
    "price": "$19.99",
    "description": "This is an example product description."
  }
]
```

Using the **LLM Extract** node, you can effectively automate the process of extracting structured data from web pages, making your data collection tasks more efficient and accurate.
