# Update Synonyms
The **Update Synonyms** node allows you to update the synonyms for a specific index in your MeiliSearch instance. This is particularly useful when you want to enhance search results by considering different terms as equivalent.

<Node id="@buildship/update-synonyms-of-meilisearch" version="1.2.0" />

## Inputs
To use this node, you need to provide the following inputs:

- **API Key**: The API Key of your MeiliSearch instance. You can obtain this from your server's configuration or dashboard.
  - **Example**: `xyzABC123APIKey`

- **Host URL**: The Host URL of your MeiliSearch server. This is available in the configuration settings or dashboard of your MeiliSearch instance.
  - **Example**: `http://127.0.0.1:7700`

- **Index Name**: The Index Name within your MeiliSearch instance that you want to update.
  - **Example**: `books`

- **Synonyms**: An object where each key is a term, and its value is an array of its synonyms. This helps the search engine understand that different terms are equivalent.
  - **Example**: 
    ```json
    {
      "book": ["novel", "story"],
      "author": ["writer", "novelist"]
    }
    ```

## Output
Upon successful execution, the node will return a confirmation that the synonyms have been updated. The output is an object containing the following property:

- **success**: A boolean value indicating the success of the operation.
  - **Example**: 
    ```json
    {
      "success": true
    }
    ```
