# Calculate Distance
The "Calculate Distance" node is used to determine the distance between two addresses using Google's Directions API. This node not only calculates the distance in meters but also provides a human-readable distance and the expected travel duration. **To use this node, you must first enable the [Directions API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/directions-backend.googleapis.com?project=_)**.

<Node id="@buildship/gmaps-calculate-distance" version="1.1.0" />

## Inputs
The node takes the following inputs to perform the distance calculation:

- **API Key** (string): Your Google API key, which you can obtain by following [these instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key).
  - **Sample Input**: `"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"`
- **Origin** (string): The starting address for the distance calculation.
  - **Sample Input**: `"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA"`
- **Destination** (string): The ending address for the distance calculation.
  - **Sample Input**: `"1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA"`
- **Mode** (string): The mode of transportation to be used. The possible values are:
  - `driving`
  - `walking`
  - `bicycling`
  - `transit`
  - **Sample Input**: `"driving"`

## Output
The node returns a detailed result object comprising the following:

- **Distance Meters** (number): The calculated distance in meters.
  - **Example**: `123456`
- **Distance Readable** (string): A human-readable distance such as "1.2 km" or "0.7 miles".
  - **Example**: `"123 km"`
- **Duration** (string): The expected duration to cover the distance.
  - **Example**: `"1 hour 23 mins"`

This comprehensive information allows users to understand not only the exact distance but also gives context to Travel duration and mode of transport.

This node is integrated efficiently with Google's Directions API to bring accurate and real-time distance calculation which can be immensely useful for various applications ranging from logistics to travel planning.
