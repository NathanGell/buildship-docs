# BuildShip Workflows

BuildShip Workflows provides a set of pre-configured nodes that enable seamless interaction between multiple workflows
within the BuildShip platform. These nodes allow you to trigger, manage, and coordinate activities between different
workflows, enhancing process automation and optimizing task execution. This integration helps streamline complex
workflows by enabling modular design and efficient data flow between interconnected processes.
