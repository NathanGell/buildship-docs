# Create Document
The **Create Document** node allows you to create or update a document within a specified Firestore collection. This node supports adding document reference fields by specifying them in a special format.

<Node id="@buildship/create-firestore-document" version="1.3.1" />

## Inputs
The node expects the following inputs:

- **Project ID:** The ID of your Firestore project. Ensure that Service Account permissions are granted for access. [Learn more](https://docs.buildship.com/tutorials/firebase-project).
- **Collection Name:** Name of the Firestore collection where the document will reside.
- **Data:** An object containing the data to set in the document. To add a document reference field, include the path to the document. Use the prefix `_ref:` to identify a reference.

  **Sample Input:**
  ```json
  {
    "price": 24, 
    "status": "pending",
    "ref": "_ref:customers/D5KjdTWkV9YeY3CXHApo" // this is a document reference field
  }
  ```

- **Merge:** A boolean indicating whether to merge the provided data with any existing document.
- **Document ID:** If you want to manually set the document's ID, provide it here. Leave blank for auto-generated IDs.

## Output
Upon successful execution, the node returns an object with the following structure:
- **Status:** A string indicating the status of the operation (e.g., "success!").
- **ID:** The ID of the created or updated document.
- **Path:** The full path of the document in the Firestore collection.

The returned response helps in verifying the document creation or update operation status.
