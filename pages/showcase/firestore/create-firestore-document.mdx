# Create Document
This node allows you to create or update a document in a specified Firestore collection. It supports document reference field types, enabling sophisticated Firestore operations within your workflow.

<Node id="@buildship/create-firestore-document" version="1.3.0" />

## Inputs
The node accepts the following inputs:

- **Project ID:**  
  The ID of your Firestore project. Note that this requires additional steps for granting Service Account permissions. For detailed setup instructions, refer to [our setup blog](https://docs.buildship.com/tutorials/firebase-project).

- **Collection Name:**  
  The name of the Firestore collection where the document will be created or updated.

- **Document ID (Optional):**  
  Manually set the document ID for the new Firestore document. Leave this field blank for auto-generated Document IDs.

- **Merge:**  
  A boolean value indicating whether to merge the data with any existing document.

- **Data:**  
  The data to set in the document. To create a document reference field, include the path to the document.

  **Sample Input:**

  ```json
  {
    "price": 24, 
    "status": "pending",
    "ref": "customers/D5KjdTWkV9YeY3CXHApo" // this is not a doc ref field
  }
  ```

  In case of a document reference, the value should be in the format `_ref:collectionName/documentId`. The `_ref:` prefix is used to identify the value as a reference.

  **Sample Input:**

  ```json
  {
    "price": 24, 
    "status": "pending",
    "ref": "_ref:customers/D5KjdTWkV9YeY3CXHApo" // this is a doc ref field
  }
  ```

## Output
The node returns an object with the following properties:

- **Status:**  
  A string indicating the operation's success status.

- **Document ID:**  
  The ID of the created or updated document.

- **Path:**  
  The full path to the created or updated document within the Firestore collection.
