# Update Field Value
The **Update Field Value** node is used to update a specific field within a Firestore document using a given value. This process involves taking a new value and a field key and applying the change to the specified Firestore document path within a project.

<Node id="@buildship/update-firestore-field-value" version="1.2.0" />

## Inputs
The **Update Field Value** node requires the following inputs:

- **Project ID**: The ID of your Firestore project. It is crucial to ensure Service Account permissions are set up correctly. Learn more from the [detailed setup blog](https://docs.buildship.com/tutorials/firebase-project).

  **Example**: `my-firestore-project-id`
  
- **Document Path**: The path to the specific Firestore document where the field will be updated. 

  **INPUT FORMAT**: `collectionName/documentId`
  
  **Example**: `users/12345`
  
- **Field Key**: The key of the field you wish to update. This can be a nested key separated by dots.

  **Example**: `profile.name`
  
- **New Value**: The new value to be set for the specified field. For document references, use the format `_ref:collectionName/documentId`.

  **Example**: `John Doe`
  
  **For Document Reference**: `_ref:customers/D5KjdTWkV9YeY3CXHApo`

## Output
Upon successful execution, the node returns an object indicating the timestamp when the write operation was performed. The write time includes both `seconds` and `nanoseconds` to ensure precise recording of the operation.

```json
{
  "_writeTime": {
    "_nanoseconds": 123000000,
    "_seconds": 1619446200
  }
}
```

This output is critical for tracking when the document update occurred and ensuring data consistency within the Firestore database.
