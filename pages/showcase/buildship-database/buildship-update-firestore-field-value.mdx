# Update Field Value
Updates a field value in BuildShip's Firestore document with a specified new value. This node interacts with Google's Firestore to update a field specified by its key within a document path, and it supports document reference values in a specific format.

<Node id="@buildship/buildship-update-firestore-field-value" version="1.2.0" />

## Inputs
This node requires three inputs:

1. **Document Path (`docPath`)**: The path to the BuildShip's Firestore document. The format should follow `collectionName/documentId`.

   **Example**: `customers/12345`
   
2. **Field Key (`fieldKey`)**: The key of the field that needs to be updated. This can be a single key or a nested key separated by dots.

   **Example**: `contact.email`
   
3. **New Value (`newValue`)**: The new value to update the field with. If the value is a document reference, it should be in the format `_ref:collectionName/documentId`. The `_ref:` prefix is used to identify the value as a reference.

   **Example**: `_ref:customers/D5KjdTWkV9YeY3CXHApo`
   
## Output
Upon successful execution, the node returns an object containing metadata about the write operation, specifically the timestamp when the write occurred.

### Example Output:
```json
{
  "_writeTime": {
    "_seconds": 1636553058,
    "_nanoseconds": 123456789
  }
}
```

This output confirms that the field update was performed successfully and provides the precise time of the write operation in Firestore.

By using this node, developers can efficiently update specific fields in their Firestore documents while handling document references seamlessly.
