# Delete Collection Field
The **Delete Collection Field** node allows you to delete a custom field in a collection within your Webflow CMS. This operation is performed for individual fields and does not support bulk deletion.

<Node id="@buildship/oauth-webflow-delete-cms-field" version="1.1.0" />

## Inputs
To use this node, the following inputs are required:

- **Collection ID:** The unique identifier for a collection within your Webflow project. You can fetch the list of available collections using the **List Collections** node.
- **Field ID:** The unique identifier for a field within the collection. This can be obtained by using the **Get Collection Details** node to get a list of all fields within your Webflow CMS collection.

### Example
Here is an example of how the inputs should be provided:

- **Collection ID:** `5f3e3a401eb0c5eadf5a7767`
- **Field ID:** `5f5f3afd7e1b3b9d8c6d5bb2`

## Output
The output of the node will be a boolean indicating the success of the field deletion, along with a message confirming the deletion.

### Example Output
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Field 5f5f3afd7e1b3b9d8c6d5bb2 deleted successfully"
}
```

The node ensures that the specified field is successfully removed from the specified collection, and provides a success message to confirm the action.
