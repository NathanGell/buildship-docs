# BuildShip Database

BuildShip provides pre-defined nodes for seamless interaction with its own Database service, allowing users to perform a
variety of database operations. With these nodes, you can easily create, read, update, and delete records in your
BuildShip Database. The integration also supports complex queries, data filtering, and batch operations to streamline
your workflows.

## Nodes

<Cards num={3}>
  {nodes.map((node) => (
    <NodeCard
      key={node.meta.id}
      title={node.meta.name}
      image={node.meta.icon.url}
      href={`/showcase/buildship-database/${node.meta.id}`}
    />
  ))}
</Cards>
