# Visually build with Supabase with low-code and AI

This integration allows you to work with Supabase database in low-code/no-code style. Using BuildShip, you can connect
to your Supabase database easily and **build APIs, scheduled jobs and any backend workflow automation or cloud
functions** on top of your Supabase database - without the need to code.

You can use 100s of prebuilt nodes, templates and connectors to popular tools and AI models like **Replicate**,
**OpenAI**, **HuggingFace**, **StabilityAI**, **ElevenLabs** etc. If any integration is missing, you can simply ask AI
and it will generate one for you right from BuildShip's UI! 🪄
