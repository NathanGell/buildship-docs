# Supabase Integration

This integration allows you to work with Supabase database in low-code/no-code style. Using BuildShip, you can connect
to your Supabase database easily and build APIs, scheduled jobs and any backend workflow automation or cloud functions
on top of your Supabase database - without the need to code.

You can use 100s of prebuilt nodes, tempaltes and connectors to popular tools and AI models like Replicate, OpenAI etc.
And if any integration is missing, you can simply ask AI and it will generate one for you right from BuildShip's UI.
