Logging plays a vital role in the development and maintenance of workflows. It allows you to **track and understand the
flow** of your workflow, **monitor variable values**, **monitor total and individual execution time of full workflow and
individual nodes**,and **identify potential issues**.

Logging statements serve as essential tools in your workflow development toolkit. They offer several advantages:

- **Debugging**: Logging helps you identify and resolve issues within your workflow's logic.
- **Monitoring**: By reviewing log messages, you can monitor the execution flow, identify bottlenecks, and improve
  efficiency.
- **Data Visualization**: Logging enables you to visualize data, making it easier to understand how data changes as the
  workflow progresses.
- **Track Execution Time**: Logging enables you to monitor workflow execution time for individual nodes and the entire
  workflow and optimize workflows.
- **Organize Group logs by nodes** - Logging enables you to easily perform debugging and testing, allowing you to
  identify and resolve errors efficiently.
- **Mock Requests** - Easily test and rerun a request by clicking the test button for each execution (note: headers
  cannot be accessed for security reasons).
- **LIVE logs for test execution** - Get real-time insights into your workflows for a faster debugging experience.

You can harness the power of logging in BuildShip through two primary methods:

## Via Logging Core Node

The Logging Core Node provides a straightforward way to log messages and data directly to the BuildShip logging console.
Here's how:

<Image src={logging2} alt='Logging Core Node' width={1200} />

<Steps>

### Add a Node

Click on the "Add a Node" button within your workflow. This will open the Nodeverse Library, where you can explore
various nodes.

### Find the "Log Message to Console" Node

Within the Core Nodes section, locate the "Log Message to Console" node. You can also use the search bar to quickly find
this node.

### Insert and Configure the Node

Insert the "Log Message to Console" node into your workflow. Customize the node by adding a string or
[variable](/basics/variables) that you want to log.

</Steps>

## Via Logging Statements in Node Logic

Another way to integrate logging in your workflow is by directly adding logging statements within the logic of
individual nodes. This method gives you more control over when and what to log. Here's how:

<Steps>
### Select and Edit a Logic Node
Choose a Logic Node within your workflow. Open the Node Editor `</>` to access and edit the node's logic.

### Import the Logging Module

Inside the parameters of the node, import the logging module. This allows you to use the logging functions.

```js copy
export default async function yourNodeFunction({ input }, { logging }) {
  // the function body
  logging.log('This is a logging statement');
  logging.warn('This is a warning message');
  logging.error('This is an error message');
}
```

Within your node's logic, utilize the logging functions to log messages, variables, and other relevant data.

</Steps>

## Viewing the Cloud Logs

After incorporating logging statements into your workflow, you can conveniently view these statements using the built-in
logging panel in BuildShip.

<Image src={loggingPanel} alt='Logging Panel' width={1200} />

- The logging panel is **located at the bottom** of your BuildShip Workspace, initially minimized.
- You can simply open or close the panel using the **expand button** on the right to **see old logs**, if any.
- To **view logs specific to a node** or the entire workflow, switch from the default Workflow view to the Node view. To
  view logs for a particular node, select the node from the Node View.
- To view **LIVE logs** for test execution, click on the test button from the workflow test panel and get real-time
  insights into your workflows for a faster debugging experience, you can also view the logs for each node execution.
  Note that production logs automatically get populated in the logs panel in ~45 seconds, you can click the refresh icon
  to load production logs instantly.
  <Image src={liveLogs} alt='Live logs' width={1200} />
- To send a mock request, click on the test button for each execution (note: headers cannot be accessed for security
  reasons). This will help you test and rerun a request easily.
