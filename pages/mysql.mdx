The MySQL Integration in BuildShip allows users to interact seamlessly with MySQL databases, performing a range of
operations without extensive coding.

With BuildShip's nodes, users can connect to their MySQL databases effortlessly, allowing the creation of APIs,
scheduled jobs, and other backend workflows without extensive coding requirements.

## How to Connect to MySQL

To connect MySQL with BuildShip, users need to ensure they have a hosted version of MySQL that is publicly accessible
from the internet. Localhosts or local IP addresses cannot be used for this integration.

To use the MySQL Nodes, we’d need the following information:

- Database Host
- Database Name
- Database Username
- Database Password

Follow our dedicated guide below to understand how to establish a connection, enabling operations such as reading,
creating, updating, and deleting data within your MySQL database.

executing custom SQL queries, and fetching desired data based on specific criteria. You can find the following nodes in
the Node Library under the MySQL Integration:

- **Insert Row:** Insert new data into a MySQL table with ease.
- **Update Row:** Update specific rows in a MySQL table based on defined criteria.
- **Delete Row:** Remove rows from a MySQL table using specified filters.
