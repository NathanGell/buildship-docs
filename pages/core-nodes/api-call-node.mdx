## Steps to use API Call Node

<Steps>

### Accessing the Node Editor

- Navigate to the Node Editor where you are building your workflow.
- Locate the 'API Call' node that you want to configure.

### Testing the 'API Call' Node

- **HTTP Method**: Set the HTTP method for the request. In most cases, you'll choose 'GET' for retrieving data from an
  API.
- **Content Type**: Specify the content type for the request. For JSON data, set it to 'application/json'.
- **URL**: Enter the URL of the API you want to call.

### Returning the API Call Output

Once you've configured the 'API Call' node, you can proceed to test it. To do so, follow these steps:

- Click on the 'Test Node' button located in the top-right corner of the Node Editor.
- The platform will execute the 'API Call' node's logic using the parameters you entered.

- If the execution is successful, a green check-mark will appear on the node.
<Callout emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
  In case of an unsuccessful execution, an error message will be displayed. For example, an incorrect URL can lead to
  an error.
</Callout>
- To view the output of the test run, click on the check-mark. You can copy the output by scrolling to the bottom and
  clicking 'Copy Value'.

</Steps>

### Logging During Node Execution

If you need to log specific information during the execution of the 'API Call' node, you can include a logging statement
in the code. This can be helpful for debugging and monitoring the behavior of your workflow.
