The Parallel node allows you to run other nodes at the same time. This node is useful if you want to independent pieces of logic to run at the same time, saving valueable time in your workflow.

In parallel mode, each element of the input is processed concurrently. This is suitable when each iteration is independent and can be executed simultaneously. For example, making API calls to multiple endpoints.

Parallel processing executes actions simultaneously for each element, while series processing executes actions one after another.

**Example: Processing Multiple API Calls**

    Suppose you have a list of URLs that you want to send API requests to simultaneously. You can use the Loop node in parallel mode to achieve this:

    **Input**: `JSON array containing URLs`

    **Loop Body**: Inside the loop, add a series of nodes that make API calls to the URLs.

    This configuration ensures that each API call is executed in parallel, optimizing time and efficiency.
