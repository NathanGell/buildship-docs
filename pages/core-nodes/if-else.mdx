# Branch (If Else)

The **Branch node** is a conditional node in your workflow, designed to **execute different sets of actions based on a
specific condition**. This node provides a powerful way to control the flow of your workflow, making it flexible and
dynamic.

## Using the Branch node

The Branch node **evaluates a base condition**. If the condition evaluates to "**true**", the node executes the actions
in the "**Then**" block. If the condition evaluates to "**false**", it proceeds to execute the actions in the "**Else**"
block.

## Supported Comparison Operators

To define your conditions, the "Branch" node supports the following comparison operators:

- `==`: Checks whether two values are equal
- `!=`: Checks whether two values are not equal.
- `>`: Checks whether the first value is greater than the second value.
- `<`: Checks whether the first value is less than the second value.
- `>=`: Checks whether the first value is greater than or equal to the second value.
- `<=`: Checks whether the first value is less than or equal to the second value.

<Callout type='tip' emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
  **These comparison operators also work on strings**. You can use them to compare string values and make decisions
  based on string conditions.
</Callout>

With these operators, you can construct various conditions to control the flow of your workflow based on specific data
or inputs.

## Example: Conditional Response Based on Request Body

In this example, we'll create a workflow that receives an HTTP request with a JSON body. The workflow will check the
value of the `number` key in the request body. If the value is greater than 10, the workflow will return a message
saying that the number is greater than 10. If the value is less than or equal to 10, the workflow will return a message
saying that the number is less than or equal to 10.

<Steps>
    ### HTTP Trigger Node
    Create a workflow with an HTTP Request Trigger to receive incoming requests.

    ### Add Branch Node
    Add a Branch (If Else) node to the workflow.

    ### Set Branch Condition
    Click on the **Expression Menu**, select **Expression Editor**. Set the Branch node's condition as:
    ```js copy
    ctx["request"]["body"]["number"] > 10
    ```

    ### Setting Then and Else conditions
    - In the "**Then**" block of the Branch node, add a **Return** node with the message:
    ```js copy
    ctx["request"]["body"]["number"] + " is greater than 10".
    ```
    - In the "**Else**" block of the Branch node, add another **Return** node with the message:
    ```js copy
    ctx["request"]["body"]["number"] + " is less than 10".
    ```

    ### Test the Workflow
    Click deploy and send a request to the given endpoint with a JSON body containing the `number` key. Here's an example body JSON:

    ```json
    {
        "number": 15
    }
    ```

</Steps>

### Execution of the Example

- If the incoming requests' `number` key has a value greater than 10 (e.g., `"number": 15`), the workflow returns
  `15 is greater than 10`.

- If the incoming requests' `number` key has a value less than or equal to 10 (e.g., `"number": 5`), the workflow
  returns `5 is less than or equal to 10`.

## Nested Branch (Nested If Else)

A **Nested Branch** or a **Nested If Else** is a conditional structure within another conditional structure. Using
nested branches allows you to create more complex conditional logic in your workflow by combining multiple levels of
"if-else" statements. This approach is useful when you need to evaluate multiple conditions sequentially, with each
condition leading to a different set of actions.

### Nested Branch Example

Let's consider a scenario where we want to categorize incoming numbers into three groups: "Greater than 20," "Between 10
and 20," and "Less than or equal to 10."

<Steps>
    ### HTTP Trigger Node
    Create a workflow with an HTTP Request Trigger to receive incoming requests.

    ### Add Branch Node
    Add a Branch (If Else) node to the workflow.

    ### Set Branch Condition
    Click on the **Expression Menu**, select **Expression Editor**. Set the Branch node's condition as:
    ```js copy
    ctx["request"]["body"]["number"] < 20
    ```
    ### Adding Nested conditions
    - In the "**Then**" block of the first Branch node, add another Branch (If Else) node.
    - Set the condition in the second Branch node as
    ```js copy
    ctx["request"]["body"]["number"] > 10
    ```
    - In the "**Then**" block of the second Branch node, add a Return node with the expression:
    ```js copy
    ctx["request"]["body"]["number"] + " is between 10 and 20"
    ```
    - In the "**Else**" block of the second Branch node, add another Return node with the message:
    ```js copy
    ctx["request"]["body"]["number"] + " is less than or equal to 10"
    ```
    - In the "**Else**" block of the first Branch node (i.e., if the number is not greater than 20), add a Return node with the message:
    ```js copy
    ctx["request"]["body"]["number"] + " is greater than 20"
    ```

    ### Test the Workflow
    Click deploy and send a request to the given endpoint with a JSON body containing the `number` key. Here's an example body JSON:

    ```json
    {
        "number": 15
    }
    ```

</Steps>
