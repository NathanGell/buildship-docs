## Prerequisites
Before you can create a chatbot on WhatsApp, you need to have the following:

1. A verified business on Facebook.
2. A registered WhatsApp business phone number.
3. Access to the official WhatsApp Business API.

## Setting up a Meta Developer Account

- **Sign up for a Meta Developer Account**: Go to https://developers.facebook.com and click the "Login" button. You can use your Facebook account associated with your company or create a new account.

</Steps>

- **Add WhatsApp to your app**: In your app, add WhatsApp. Meta will provide you with a test phone number and a temporary token that needs to be refreshed every 24 hours. If you have an existing business account, you can add that instead.

- **Set up the webhook in BuildShip**: In BuildShip, clone the WhatsApp webhook verification template and ship you workflow. 

   Copy the "shipped" URL and add it to the Callback URL on Meta Developer Account in your dahsboard under  WhatsApp --> Configuration. Enter the verify token you saved earlier, then click "Verify" and "Save".

- **Configure the webhook**: To connect the WhatsApp API to BuildShip, you need to configure a webhook. In your Meta Developer Account, go to "WhatsApp" >> "Configuration" >> "Edit Webhook". Enter the callback URL (see step 5 for setting up BuildShip) and a verify token (any text or number that you'll save for later).

- **Subscribe to messaging on webhooks**: To receive all events from WhatsApp in BuildShip, you need to subscribe to messaging on webhooks. Click "Manage" (Webhook fields) and subscribe to messages.

    <Image src={step9} alt='Subscribe to messaging on webhooks' width={1200} />

- **Update BuildShip's flow**: Update BuildShip's flow to send an API response for all the events received from WhatsApp.

- **Test setup with test message**: Go to "WhatsApp" >> "API Setup". Add your number and test if you're receiving a message from WhatsApp. You'll recieve a test of successful connection from WhatsApp

## Get App ID and App Secret

On the Meta dahsboard, go to your app and click App settings where you'll find your App ID and App Secret.

Note: Your app must be verified by Meta before obtaining App ID and App secret.

## Setting up a Permanent Token

To set up a permanent token, you need a Meta Business Account. Full documentation [link](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/get-started#access-tokens).

1. **Create a system user**: Log in to your Meta Business Account (https://developers.facebook.com) >> "Settings" >> "Business Assets". If you've already set up your Meta Developer Account, you'll see your app and WhatsApp Test Account. Go to "Settings" >> "Business Settings" >> "System users" >> "Add". Enter a system username and system user role.


2. **Associate the system user with your app**: Go to "Add Assets" >> "App". Select your app and give the system user partial or full access. Click "Save changes".


3. **Generate a new token**: Click "Generate new token" >> Select your app from the dropdown menu. Make sure "whatsapp_business_messaging" and "whatsapp_business_management" are turned on. Click "Generate token".


4. **Save the token**: Save the Access Token as it's not saved in Facebook. This is a permanent token that can be used for your Meta Developer app.


By following these steps, you'll be able to set up a WhatsApp bot using the Meta Developer Account and the WhatsApp Business API, connected to the BuildShip platform.
