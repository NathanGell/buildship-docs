Google Workspace is an integral part of managing communication and improving efficiency. Formerly known as G Suite and
Google Apps, Google Workspace provides a suite of productivity and office tools, including **Gmail**, **Google Drive**,
**Google Docs**, **Google Sheets**, and **Google Meet**.

BuildShip introduces pre-built Google Workspace Nodes for Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs, and Google Sheets, with
more integrations in the pipeline. These GSuite nodes are seamlessly integrated with OAuth, allowing you to connect to
your Google Tools through a single sign-in process. No need for additional setup or managing API Keys.

Automate your daily tasks, from importing information into Google Sheets to creating documents in Google Docs or
automating Gmail communications - all in low-code.

## Google Workspace Nodes

## Authentication Process

OAuth Nodes for Google Workspace integrations utilize a distinctive Fingerprint Icon, initially displayed in red to
indicate an unauthenticated state.

### Initiating Authentication

- Click on the Fingerprint Icon associated with the desired Google Workspace node.
- This action initiates an OAuth authentication window, prompting users to log in to the integration securely via their
  associated Google Accounts.

### Successful Authentication

- Upon successful login, the Fingerprint Icon transitions to green, signaling the completion of the authentication
  process.

- In cases where the icon doesn't transition automatically, users can manually select the authenticated user account by
  clicking the Fingerprint Icon again.
