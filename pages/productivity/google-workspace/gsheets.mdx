The Google Sheets Nodes allow you to interact with your Google Sheets account. You can create, update, and delete
spreadsheets, as well as read and write data to them.

## Get Sheets

Fetches a Google Spreadsheet by utilizing the Google Sheets API. This function requires the URL of the Google
Spreadsheet and optionally a specific range within the sheet to fetch the data from.

<Node id='@buildship/oauth-gsheets-get-sheet' version='2.0.0' />

### Inputs

<Image src={gsheet1} alt='Gsheet Node' width={1200} />

To effectively use this node, you need to provide the following inputs:

1. **Sheet URL** The URL of the Google Spreadsheet you want to fetch. The URL is available in your Google Sheets. You
   can copy it from the address bar of your browser.

**Sample Input:** `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheet-id/edit`

2. **Sheet Name** The name of the sheet within the Google Spreadsheet. This can be found at the bottom left corner of
   your Google Sheet. You can also specify a range if needed, for example, `Sheet1!B2:B` if you want to read the `B`
   column except the header row.

**Sample Input:** `Sheet1`

### Output

The node returns the content of the Google Spreadsheet in the following structure:

- **majorDimension:** Represents the dimension used when reporting data (e.g., ROWS or COLUMNS).
- **values:** An array of arrays containing the data from the specified range.
- **range:** The range over which the data is retrieved.

Here's a sample of what the output looks like:

```json
{
  "majorDimension": "ROWS",
  "values": [
    ["Name", "Age", "Location"],
    ["Alice", "30", "New York"],
    ["Bob", "25", "San Francisco"]
  ],
  "range": "Sheet1!A1:C3"
}
```

## Create Sheet

The "Create Sheet" node initializes a new Google Spreadsheet with a specified name. This node leverages the Google
Sheets API to create a new spreadsheet, offering a foundation for further data manipulation and storage.

<Node id='@buildship/oauth-gdocs-create-sheet' version='2.0.0' />

### Inputs

The node requires the following input:

- **Sheet Name**: The name or title for the new spreadsheet to be created. This string input is essential to identify
  the newly created sheet.

**Sample Input:** `Testing Data`

### Output

Upon successful creation, the node returns an object containing the following properties:

- **spreadsheetId:** A unique string identifier for the created spreadsheet.
- **spreadsheetUrl:** A string URL that links directly to the new spreadsheet.
- **sheets:** An array of sheet objects, each with properties detailing the sheet type, ID, index, title, and grid
  properties including row and column counts.
- **properties:** An object with additional attributes such as the spreadsheet theme, auto-recalculation settings, time
  zone, title, locale, and default formatting options.

These output properties collectively describe the newly created spreadsheet, making it easy to locate, access, and
further customize.

## Add Row

The **Add Row** node integrates with Google Sheets to append new rows of data to a specific spreadsheet. This
functionality is ideal for automating the addition of data entries, ensuring your Google Sheets stay up-to-date
effortlessly.

<Node id='@buildship/oauth-gsheets-add-row' version='2.0.0' />

### Inputs

To use this node, you need to provide the following inputs:

1. **Sheet URL** The URL of the Google Spreadsheet where the rows will be added.

**Sample Input**: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEgMxmFd29SGjEuJZ58ee94W_aU0Xx4pUngG628uJsk`

2. **Sheet Name** The name of the sheet within the spreadsheet. You can find this in the bottom left corner of your
   Google Sheet.

**Sample Input**: `Sheet1`

3. **Cell Number** The cell number to start adding the new row. This prevents accidental overwrites. We can also use
   this field to specify range. For example, if we just want to write to the `C` column except the header row, we could
   specify: `C2:C` and select the **Dimension** field as `column`.

**Sample Input**: `A11` or `C2:C`

4. **Data Array** The new values to be added as rows to the spreadsheet. Each sub-array represents a row. **Sample
   Input**:

```
[
    ["Cell1", "Cell2"],
    ["Cell3", "Cell4"]
]
```

5. **Dimension** The major dimension of the values to be added, either `ROWS` or `COLUMNS`.

- **Sample Input**: `ROWS`

### Output

The output of this node is the response from the Google Sheets API, which includes the details of the updated
spreadsheet. It provides information about the cells that were modified, ensuring that the data was added correctly.

## Batch Update Sheet

Batch updates values in a Google Sheet. This node is technically a bit complex to entertain more versatile use cases. To
simply add values to a Google Sheet, check out the [Add Row](#add-row) node.

<Node id='@buildship/oauth-gsheets-batch-update' version='2.0.0' />

### Inputs

To use this node, you'll need to provide the following inputs:

- **Sheet URL**: The URL of the Google Spreadsheet to update. Available in the following format in your Google Sheets:
  `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheet-id/edit`.
  [Refer API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/batchUpdate).

- **Value Input Option**: Specifies how the input data should be interpreted. It can be either `RAW` or `USER_ENTERED`.
  This determines how the input data is interpreted by the Google Sheets API.

- **Data**: The new values to apply to the spreadsheet. Example input:

```json
[
  {
    "range": "Sheet1!A1:B2", // Range to update in A1 notation
    "majorDimension": "ROWS", // ROWS or COLUMNS
    "values": [
      ["New Value 1", "New Value 2"],
      ["New Value 3", "New Value 4"]
    ]
  }
]
```

- **Include Values In Response**: Determines if the update response should include the values of the cells that were
  updated. Defaults to `true`.

- **Response Value Render Option**: Determines how values in the response should be rendered. Options include
  `FORMATTED_VALUE`, `UNFORMATTED_VALUE`, and `FORMULA`.

- **Response Date Time Render Option**: Determines how dates, times, and durations in the response should be rendered.
  Options include `SERIAL_NUMBER` and `FORMATTED_STRING`.

### Output

The output of this node will be an object representing the response from the Google Sheets API, containing details about
the batch update operation.

Example output:

```json
{
  "spreadsheetId": "sampleSpreadsheetId",
  "totalUpdatedRows": 2,
  "totalUpdatedColumns": 2,
  "totalUpdatedCells": 4,
  "totalUpdatedSheets": 1
}
```

This response will include various metrics on the number of affected rows, columns, cells, and sheets due to the batch
update operation.
