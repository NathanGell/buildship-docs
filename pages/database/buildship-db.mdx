Every BuildShip Project is equipped with a **built-in Firebase Database and Storage** which can be used to store data.
The BuildShip database is a ready-to-use database and can be easily manipulated using the **BuildShip Database Nodes**.

- **No Additional Setup:** Everything is pre-configured and ready for immediate use.
- **Easy Access:** Users can directly access and interact with the Firestore database through BuildShip.
- **Full Functionality:** You can perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and more, making it a
  comprehensive solution for your Firebase integration needs.

  Use the BuildShip Tables to visualize and manage your BuildShip Firestore data in a Spreadsheet UI. (This feature is
  only available for users on the Pro and Expert plan.)
