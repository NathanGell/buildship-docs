## Steps to connect with Pinecone Database
<Steps>

### Setup Pinecone App
 Create an account on [Pinecone](https://app.pinecone.io/) --> setup application and add organization (follow pinecone tour).

### Create a New Index
Create an Index to manage vectors and access the required credentials.
<br/>

- Give your index a name.
- Add required configurations such as dimensions and metric
- Click create

### Get Credentials and Variables from created Index

You are all set to use BuildShip's Pinecone Nodes. ðŸŽ‰
</Steps>

### Example: Lets upsert some records to Pinecone vector database

In this example we will upsert few values of records to the created Pinecone vector index.
<br/>

- Add a REST API Trigger and select POST method.
- Add all the required values from the Vector Index we created above.
- Pass the API Key.
- Sample Array for record: 
```json 
[
  {
    id: '1',
    values: [0.236, 0.971],
  },
]
```
- Lets deploy our workflow and test the API on Postman (choose your favorite tool)
