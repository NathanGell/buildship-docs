# REST API Call Trigger

With this powerful trigger node, you can initiate automation by sending HTTP requests to specified URL endpoints. When setting up the REST API Call Trigger, you define the path, choose the HTTP method (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE), and create the complete endpoint URL.

To set up a REST API Call Trigger in your BuildShip workflow, follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Add Trigger Node
 
In a fresh workflow, click "Add Trigger," and select "Rest API Call" from the available options. The Rest API Call trigger comes with three fields:

- **Path:** Specify the URL Endpoint to which you want to send the request.
- **Method:** Choose the appropriate HTTP method for your request, such as GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE.
- **Endpoint URL:** This is the complete request URL, including the endpoint you specified in the Path field.
 
### Platform to send Requests

The REST API Call Trigger allows you to pick any platform to trigger an HTTP request to the specified Endpoint URL. This flexibility empowers you to integrate BuildShip with various applications and services seamlessly.
