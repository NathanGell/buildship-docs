# Triggers 101: Initiating the workflow

Triggers are the basis of the execution of any workflow. Each trigger node **serves as a starting point** for your workflow, allowing you to automate processes based on specific events or schedules. You can only add a single trigger node to a workflow.

## What are Trigger Nodes?

Trigger nodes play a pivotal role in BuildShip as they are the **catalysts responsible for initiating the execution** of a workflow. Think of them as the "*starting points*" that kickstart the entire automation process.

<div style={{
      display: 'flex',
      justifyContent: 'center', // Center horizontally
      alignItems: 'center', // Center vertically
    }}>

</div>
