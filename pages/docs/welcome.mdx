BuildShip allows you to build powerful LLM applications, RESTful APIs, and Workflows **without extensive coding knowledge**. Along with the support for standard HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` for building your API Endpoints, BuildShip also provides you **time and event based triggers**.

Connect with your favorite AI-models, API services, and backends on your fingertips. Extend your workflow's capabilities with JavaScript / TypeScript code and 1M + NPM packages! 🤯

## What's inside? 👀

Built on top of powerful tools like **Firebase** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to give you a friction-free serverless development experience. Now you can quickly transform your ideas into cloud-deployed scripts within seconds, without leaving your browser.
BuildShip uses **Cloud Run** to run your code in a serverless environment. It also supports EventArc-based backend triggers, HTTP and webhook backend triggers, data triggers, and BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) compatibility.

### Combine the power of any AI Model 🧠
Integrate the leading multimodal AI models and services with your APIs and Workflows like **ChatGPT**, **Stable Diffusion**, **Midjourney**, **DALL-E 2**, and many more.

### Build with pre-built nodes from THE NODEVERSE 🧩
Explore and select from our library of pre-built nodes or generate your own using AI. Tweak the nodes to your liking and build your own custom workflows.

### Build with JavaScript / TypeScript 🚀
Typical low-code, no-code tools use their own complicated formulae process as you start to building anything meaningful. With BuildShip you can build on javascript / typescript - which has lot of reference materials. So you will not get “**stuck**” 😶‍🌫️ in the tool’s features and can build without limits.

### One of a kind development experience 🧑‍💻
BuildShip provides you with a powerful code editor with autocomplete, localhost like speedy debugging experience, and a sandboxing environment. Build serverless scripts fast, right from your browser! ⚡️ Schedule your function calls, save data to database, connect to any API, use 1M + NPM packages.
