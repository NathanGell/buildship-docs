# Meilisearch Integration

The Meilisearch Integration in BuildShip empowers users to harness Meilisearch for their search and indexing
requirements through a streamlined, low-code interface. Meilisearch is a **rapid, flexible, and developer-centric
open-source search engine** optimized for creating instant, highly relevant search experiences within your applications
and website

<br />

Leveraging BuildShip's Meilisearch Nodes, users can seamlessly connect to their Meilisearch instances, unlocking the
potential to craft **APIs, Scheduled Jobs, and various backend workflows centered around search and indexing tasks**.
This integration is specially crafted to reduce the need for extensive coding, facilitating straightforward management
of search indices, documents, and configurations within the intuitive BuildShip environment.

The Meilisearch Nodes provide a no-code interface for engaging with Meilisearch, ensuring a hassle-free integration of
advanced search features into your projects. From indexing new documents and tweaking search settings to conducting
intricate search queries, Meilisearch Nodes are designed to streamline these processes in a user-friendly manner.

## Prerequisites âœ…

Before you can start using the Meilisearch Nodes in BuildShip, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in
place:

### Meilisearch Instance or Meilisearch Cloud Account

You'll need access to a Meilisearch instance or a Meilisearch Cloud account. To begin with Meilisearch Cloud, setting up
an account is required. For those without an account, a 14-day free trial can be registered at Meilisearch Cloud. Follow
these steps to prepare your account and initiate your first project:

1. Navigate to [Meilisearch Cloud](https://cloud.meilisearch.com/register) to either sign up for a new account or log in
   if you are an existing user.
2. Upon login, initiate a project by selecting the "New project" or "Start free trial" button, contingent on the current
   status of your account. Projects serve as containers for indexes, tasks, and various critical components.
3. Assign a name to your project, for instance, "meilisearch-quick-start", and choose the region that is nearest to you
   to ensure the best performance. Proceed by clicking on "Create project".
4. For accounts not utilizing a free trial, you will need to select a billing plan that suits the scale of your data and
   the volume of searches you anticipate.
5. Post project creation, a brief waiting period may ensue for it to become ready. This process's progress can be
   monitored in the project list. Once the project is set up, you can begin adding documents and conducting searches.

It's important to note, generating API keys for secure interaction with your Meilisearch instance is an important step
that follows the establishment of your project.

<Image src={meilisearch1} alt='Meilisearch' width={1200} />

### API Keys

Meilisearch utilizes a master key to authenticate, granting complete operational access. For enhanced security, it is
recommended to [generate new API keys](https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/keys.html) with restricted scopes
tailored to specific use cases.

### Host

The URL of your Meilisearch instance serves as the host. This critical piece of information is required for connecting
BuildShip's Meilisearch nodes to your Meilisearch server. For more details on obtaining your Meilisearch instance's URL,
refer to the [Meilisearch documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/getting_started/quick_start.html).

<Image src={meilisearch9} alt='Typesense' width={1200} />

### Inputs

- **API Key**: The API key required for authentication with your Meilisearch instance. This should be provided as a
  secret.
- **Host**: The host address of your Meilisearch instance. This can be provided as a secret.
- **Index Name**: The unique identifier of the Meilisearch index on which you want to perform the search.
- **Query**: The search query string that you want to use for finding matching documents.
- **Limit**: The maximum number of results to return.
- **Filter**: (Optional) Conditions that filter the search results.
- **Facets Distribution**: (Optional) Facets to distribute across the search results for categorizing information.
- **Sort By**: (Optional) Criteria for sorting the search results.
- **Semantic Ratio**: Balances between semantic and keyword search, determining how much the search results should rely
  on semantic meanings versus exact keyword matches.
- **Embedder**: Specifies the vector embedding model used for the semantic search component.

<Callout>
  Employ the "Hybrid Search" function to enhance search functionality in your applications by delivering results that
  not only match the keywords but also align semantically with the user's intent. This function is particularly
  beneficial in providing more relevant and context-aware search results, thereby improving the user experience.
</Callout>

### Output

The node returns an object with the following properties:

```
{
  "success": boolean,
  "detail": string,
  "results": [
    {
      "document": object,
      "_semanticScore": number
    }
  ]
}
```

- `success` : A boolean value indicating the success of the operation.
- `detail` : A descriptive message about the outcome of the operation.
- `results`: An array of objects, where each object represents a document that matched the search query:
  - `document`: Contains the full data of the document. This would include fields like `id`, `title`, and any other
    relevant data specific to the document.
  - `_semanticScore`: A numerical value representing the semantic relevance of the document to the search query. This
    score is derived from the vector search component of the hybrid search, providing a measure of how semantically
    close the document is to the query.

<Callout>
  MeiliSearch's hybrid search capability allows a nuanced approach to search tasks, combining the precision of keyword
  searches with the depth of semantic analysis. For more comprehensive guidance on implementing hybrid searches in your
  applications, consult the [MeiliSearch documentation on hybrid
  search](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/advanced/hybrid_search.html).
