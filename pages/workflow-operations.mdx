Explore the fundamental BuildShip operations available for executing actions on nodes and workflows.

- **Copy**: Duplicates a node or workflow, creating an identical copy.
- **Paste**: Places a copied node or workflow at the desired location.
- **Delete**: Removes a selected node or workflow from the project.
- **Skip Node**: Bypasses the execution of a specific node within a workflow.
- **Add on Fail**: Defines actions or nodes to execute in the event of a workflow failure using methods and conditions.
- **Rename a workflow**: Modifies the workflow name of your choice.
- **Export API**: Exports an Open API schema of your workflow to an external file (JSON/YAML) for sharing or backup.
- **Import Open API**: Uploads the exported Open API spec to the workflow.

<Steps>

### Copy a Node or Workflow ‚úÇÔ∏è

To copy a node click '...' on the node and select 'copy'.

To copy the entire workflow, open the menu next to the workflow name at the top and select 'copy'.

### Paste a Node or Workflow üìã

After you have copied the node, paste it anywhere in the workflow by clicking '+' between connecting nodes, which will
take you to the node explorer which has an option to 'Paste from clipboard'.

To 'paste' the entire workflow, click on the top level menu and then 'paste', to override the current workflow with it.

### Delete a Node or Workflow üóëÔ∏è

Delete individual node from the node selector menu. To delete entire workflow you can either delete it from the top
level menu adjacent to the workflow name or from the workflow navbar.

### Skip Node ‚è≠Ô∏è

Skips the individual node from the node selector menu. Bypasses the execution of a specific node within a workflow. The
Skipped node won't run in test or deployment. You can unskip the node again to make it active.

### Add on Fail ‚ö†Ô∏è

Defines actions and behavior of the node with Fail options such as Retry, Terminate, and Custom flow.

### Rename a workflow ‚úèÔ∏è

To change the workflow name, open the menu next to the workflow name and visit settings to rename the workflow. Add a
name of your choice. A Few examples: Backup Workflow, Prod Workflow, Test Workflow, etc.

### Export API ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

From the project settings, this operation downloads an Open API spec of your workflow to an external file in JSON or
YAML format for sharing, backup, or import to BuildShip again.

### Import Open API ‚¨áÔ∏è

Upload the downloaded Open API spec from the node explorer menu. It will get added as an `HTTP` node which will contain
the schema.
