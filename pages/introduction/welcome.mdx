BuildShip allows you to build powerful LLM applications, RESTful APIs, and Workflows **without extensive coding knowledge**. Along with the support for standard HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` for building your API Endpoints, BuildShip also provides you **time and event based triggers**.

Connect with your favorite AI-models, API services, and backends on your fingertips. Extend your workflow's capabilities with JavaScript / TypeScript code and 1M + NPM packages! 🤯

## What's inside? 👀

Built on top of powerful tools like **Firebase** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to give you a friction-free serverless development experience. Now you can quickly transform your ideas into cloud-deployed scripts within seconds, without leaving your browser.
BuildShip uses **Cloud Run** to run your code in a serverless environment. It also supports EventArc-based backend triggers, HTTP and webhook backend triggers, data triggers, and BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) compatibility.

This documentation will contain everything you would need to leverage the ultimate power of BuildShip.

### Combine the power of any AI Model 🧠
Integrate the leading multimodal AI models and services with your APIs and Workflows like **ChatGPT**, **Stable Diffusion**, **Midjourney**, **DALL-E 2**, and many more.

### Build with pre-built nodes from THE NODEVERSE 🧩
Explore and select from our library of pre-built nodes or generate your own using AI. Tweak the nodes to your liking and build your own custom workflows.

### Build with JavaScript / TypeScript 🚀
Typical low-code, no-code tools use their own complicated formulae process as you start to building anything meaningful. With BuildShip you can build on javascript / typescript - which has lot of reference materials. So you will not get “**stuck**” 😶‍🌫️ in the tool’s features and can build without limits.

### One of a kind development experience 🧑‍💻
BuildShip provides you with a powerful code editor with autocomplete, localhost like speedy debugging experience, and a sandboxing environment. Build serverless scripts fast, right from your browser! ⚡️ Schedule your function calls, save data to database, connect to any API, use 1M + NPM packages.

### We're Open Source 💜
