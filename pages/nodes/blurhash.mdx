# BlurHash - Generate BlurHash String
BlurHash is a workflow node that generates a blurhash string from a PNG or JPEG image URL. It is a useful tool for creating a blurred placeholder for an image, which can be displayed while the actual image is loading.

## How to use?
The BlurHash node works by taking an image URL as an input, downloading the image, and then converting the image data into a blurhash string. The image can be in either PNG or JPEG format. The node uses the `axios` library to download the image, `jpeg-js` to decode JPEG images, and `get-pixels` to decode PNG images. The blurhash string is generated using the `blurhash` library.

## Inputs / Outputs
The BlurHash node requires the following inputs:

- `imageUrl`: This is the URL of the image you want to generate a blurhash string from. It should be a string and is a required field. For example, `"imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg"`.

The output of the BlurHash node is a blurhash string. This string can be used to create a blurred placeholder for an image. If the node encounters an error while generating the blurhash, it will log the error and return `null`. For example, the output might look like this: `"LKF5+.8kA^p*00%2Mxuk00_4s:R*"`.

Please note that the actual blurhash string will vary depending on the input image.
