  **Store your keys in the Secret Manager** The API Key is a sensitive piece of information and should not be shared
  publicly. Make sure you keep your API Key secure and do not share it with anyone. Learn how to store your API Keys as
  secrets [here](/secrets#leveraging-buildship-secret-manager).
