## Use of Telegram Bot Trigger

The purpose of this trigger is to enable integration with Telegram's Bot API within a workflow automation platform. 
It allows you to set up a webhook for a Telegram Bot, which can then receive and handle incoming messages and other events from Telegram users or groups.


- **Setting Up a Webhook**: It allows you to set up a webhook for your Telegram bot. This webhook is a URL to which Telegram will send incoming messages and events, making it easier for your bot to interact with users.

- **Handling Incoming Requests**: The trigger facilitates the handling of incoming requests from Telegram users. You can process these requests in your workflows and respond to user interactions.

You can create powerful, interactive workflows that respond to user interactions on Telegram using BuildShip.

### How to generate BotFather token

Obtaining a token is as simple as contacting **@BotFather**.

- Open the Telegram Messenger and sign in to your account, or create a new one if you have not already.

- Enter **@BotFather** in the search tab and choose the relevant bot.

**Note: Official Telegram bots have a tick mark beside their name.**

-  Click Start to activate the BotFather bot. You will receive a list of commands to manage the bots.

- Choose or type the **/newbot** command and click Send.

-  Choose a name for your bot. Your subscribers will see it in their conversations. Next, choose a username for your bot. The bot can be found by its username in the search bar. The username must be unique and end with the word ‚Äúbot.‚Äù

- Once you've made your selection for your bot's name, your bot will be brought to life. Shortly thereafter, you'll receive a message containing a link leading to your bot, which can be accessed at **"t.me/[bot_username]**.

- Along with this, you'll also receive guidance on configuring your bot's profile picture and a description for your bot's profile. Additionally, you'll be provided with a comprehensive list of commands to effectively manage your newly created bot. Don't forget to make note of the token value for connecting your bot to the instant messaging channel.
