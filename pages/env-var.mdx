# Environment Variables

Environment variables in BuildShip are user-defined key-value pairs that can be accessed by workflow nodes. They provide
a convenient way to store and retrieve data that needs to be shared across different parts of a workflow or project.

- Their values **can be viewed, set, and manipulated** with ease via workflow nodes.

- Variables **can be scoped at the project or workflow level**, allowing better organization and access control.

## Types of Environment Variables

BuildShip supports two types of environment variables:

### Project-level Variables

The project-level environment variables **can be accessed by any workflow within the project** they are created in.
Useful for sharing data across multiple workflows.

### Workflow-level Variables

The workflow-level environment variables are **specific to the workflow they are created in**. They are useful for
storing data that is only relevant to a particular workflow.

## Using Environment Variables

BuildShip offers three ways of setting and managing environment variables:

### 1. Environment Variables Panel

You can manage environment variables directly from the BuildShip platform using the Environment Variables panel. This
panel allows you to view, add, edit, and delete environment variables at both the project and workflow levels.

To access the Environment Variables panel, click on any node input to open the quick menu, then click on the
"Environment Variables" option. At the bottom click the "**Add Environment Variable**" button. This will open the panel
where you can manage the variables.

The **Project** tab displays project-level variables, while the **Workflow** tab displays workflow-level variables. You
can **view, add, edit, and delete variables** from these tabs as needed.

### 2. Inside Node Logic

In addition to the pre-built nodes, you can also manipulate environment variables directly within your node logic using
the `env` object provided by BuildShip. The `env` object provides functions to `get`, `set`, and `delete` environment
variables.

#### Getting Environment Variables

We can use the `env.get()` function inside the node logic to retrieve the value of an environment variable. By default,
the function looks for the variable in the `workflow` environment scope, but you can specify the `project` scope as
well.

```javascript
export default function testFunctions({ value }, { env }) {
  const firstValue = env.get('first'); // workflow
  const secondValue = env.get('second', 'project'); // project
  console.log(`firstValue: ${firstValue}`);
  console.log(`secondValue: ${secondValue}`);
  // use the values in the node as you like, or return them
  return true;
}
```

In this example, the function first retrieves the value of the `first` variable from the workflow environment, and then
retrieves the value of the `second` variable from the project environment.

#### Setting Environment Variables

We can use the `env.set()` function to set the value of an environment variable. By default, the function sets the
variable in the "workflow" environment, but you can specify the "project" environment as well.

```javascript
export default async function testFunctions({ value }, { env }) {
  await env.set([
    { name: 'first', value: 1 },
    { name: 'second', value: 2 },
  ]); // workflow
  await env.set([{ name: 'third', value: 3 }], 'project'); // project
  return true;
}
```

In this example, the function sets the values of the `first` and `second` variables in the workflow environment, and
then sets the value of the `third` variable in the project environment.

#### Deleting Environment Variables

We can use the `env.delete()` function to delete an environment variable. By default, the function deletes the variable
from the "workflow" environment, but you can specify the "project" environment as well.

```javascript
export default async function testFunctions({ values }, { env }) {
  await env.delete(['first', 'second']); // workflow
  await env.delete(['third'], 'project'); // project
  return true;
}
```

In this example, the function deletes the `first` and `second` variables from the workflow environment, and then deletes
the `third` variable from the project environment.
