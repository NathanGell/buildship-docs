There are two ways to build custom nodes in BuildShip:

- Picking pre-built nodes via the Nodeverse
- Building custom nodes via AI

## Building Custom Node via AI

In BuildShip, you have the flexibility to create custom nodes for your specific use cases using an integrated AI-powered
node building feature. This process allows you to streamline the node creation process through intelligent prompts.
Let's explore how to build custom nodes using this AI feature:

<Steps>

### Open the AI Node Generator

Click on the wand icon ðŸª„ on the top left menu bar to open the AI Node Generator. This action will open the AI Node
Generator, where you'll be able to initiate the node creation process.

### Give the prompt to generate the node

The AI Node Generator modal asks you to give a prompt for the node you want to generate. This prompt serves as a
guideline for the AI to understand your requirements.

Check out the following image for an example prompt. Once you have given the prompt, click on the "**Generate**" button
to generate the node.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡" type="info">
Users can also specify the exact format they want the output of the node to be generated in. For example, if you want the output to be in the form of a JSON object, you can specify that in the prompt.

```json
The resultant output should be in the form of a JSON object with the following format:
{
    "cover":{
        "title":string,
        "subtitle":string,
        "illustration":string
    },
    "pages":[
        {
            "index":number,
            "illustration":string,
            "text":string
        }
    ]
}
```

</Callout>

### Example Prompt to Generate Node using any API

With this example prompt you can generate a perfect node for any API or SDK module. For this example, we will generate a
node for the Adalo API.

Typically the best way to generate a node with AI is using a prompt like this.. 1. input, 2. output, and 3. docs API
code (which can be found in the official documentation -
https://help.adalo.com/integrations/the-adalo-api/push-notifications#curl.) You can customize the steps according to
your usecase.

<Callout emoji='ðŸ’¡' type='info'>
  Make sure to always import any npm package using [Named
  import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#named_import) declaration.
  Example: `import module from "module-name";` & `import Crypto from 'crypto';`
</Callout>

### Explore and Modify the Node via the Node Explorer

Once the AI generates the node based on your prompt, you can explore its functionalities and make further modifications
using "**Node Explorer &lt;/&gt;**". This is a powerful tool that allows you to fine-tune the **node's logic**, **input
parameters**, **output configurations**, and **metadata descriptions**. For more details on customizing nodes, refer to
[the editing nodes section](/basics/node#editing-nodes).

### Testing the Node

The Node Editor provides a convenient testing feature, allowing you to test the newly created node using sample data
without deploying the entire workflow. This ensures that the node operates as expected before full implementation. To
learn more about testing nodes, refer to [the testing nodes section](/testing).

</Steps>

By following these steps, you can efficiently create custom nodes tailored to your specific automation requirements! ðŸš€

## AI Autofill Input

BuildShip offers an AI Autofill feature that allows users to automatically populate node inputs with static or dynamic
data. Here's how you can effectively leverage AI Autofill to automate the node data:

<Steps>

### Open the Expression Editor (x)

While configuring a node, locate the expression icon `(x)` and click on it to open the Expression Editor.

<Image src={autofill1} alt='AI Autofill' width={1200} />

### Select and Define a Prompt

Within the expression editor, you'll notice an **Autofill icon**. Click on this icon to enable the add your prompt.

Provide a precise and descriptive prompt that articulates the specific data you need. The clarity of this prompt is
crucial for the AI to generate accurate values.

For instance, you might define a prompt like:

```copy
I need to autofill the value to the current unix timestamp
```

<Image src={autofill2} alt='AI Autofill' width={1200} />

</Steps>

All you need to do now is to check if the generated value matches your requirements. You can modify the prompt as many
times as you like and request a different value to fit your use case.
