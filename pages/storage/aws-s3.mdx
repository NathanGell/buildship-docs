BuildShip's AWS S3 Bucket Nodes enable users to interact with AWS S3 Bucket Storage, allowing them to store various
types of files such as images, audio, and video in cloud buckets. Users can bring their own storage using AWS S3 Bucket.

## Prerequisites ✅

### An AWS Account

Before using the AWS S3 Bucket nodes, ensure you have an AWS account. If you don't have one, you can
[sign up for a free account](https://aws.amazon.com/). Additionally, create an S3 Storage Bucket. For guidance, refer to
the [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html) section by Amazon.

### Access Credentials

<Image src={aws1} alt='AWS S3 Storage' width={1200} />

Make sure to gather the following access credentials:

- **Region**
- **Access ID (AWS Access Key ID)**
- **Access Secret (AWS Secret Access Key)**
- **Bucket Name**

<Callout>
**NOTE:** Modify the bucket permissions to **allow ACL (Access Control List)**, and uncheck the “**Block all public access**”. This can be done via the **Permissions tab in the Bucket settings**.

## AWS S3 Nodes

BuildShip offers the following pre-built nodes for interacting with AWS S3 Bucket Storage. Feel free to
[customize them](/core-nodes/script#customzing-the-script-node), or [create your own using AI](/ai-nodes) to suit your
specific needs.

### Upload File from External URL

This node allows users to upload a file from an external URL to an AWS S3 Bucket. It provides a convenient way to
transfer files from other sources directly to the S3 bucket.

<Image src={aws3} alt='AWS S3 Storage' width={1200} />

**Required Inputs:**

- **Region:** The AWS region to which this client will send requests.
- **Access ID:** Your AWS Access Key ID.
- **Access Secret:** AWS Secret Access Key.
- **Bucket Name:** The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from.
- **File Path:** The path of the file. **Example:** Suppose you have a folder assets with a file `og-image.jpg` in your
  S3 bucket `bucketName`, then the Key would be: `assets/og-image.jpg`

### Create File

This node creates a file with the given content in an AWS S3 bucket. It allows users to dynamically generate files and
store them directly in the S3 bucket.

<Image src={aws4} alt='AWS S3 Storage' width={1200} />

**Required Inputs:**

- **Region:** The AWS region to which this client will send requests.
- **Access ID:** Your AWS Access Key ID.
- **Access Secret:** AWS Secret Access Key.
- **Bucket Name:** The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from.
- **File Path:** The path of the file. **Example:** Suppose you have a folder assets with a file `og-image.jpg` in your
  S3 bucket `bucketName`, then the Key would be: `assets/og-image.jpg`
- **File Content:** The content of the file to be created.

### Upload Base64 File

This node uploads a Base64 encoded file to an AWS S3 bucket. It is useful when dealing with file data encoded in Base64
format.

<Image src={aws5} alt='AWS S3 Storage' width={1200} />

In some scenarios, you may receive file data in Base64 format from external sources or APIs. This node allows you to
directly upload such files to your S3 bucket without the need for additional encoding or decoding steps.

**Required Inputs:**

- **Region:** The AWS region to which this client will send requests.
- **Access ID:** Your AWS Access Key ID.
- **Access Secret:** AWS Secret Access Key.
- **Bucket Name:** The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from.
- **File Path:** The path of the file. **Example:** Suppose you have a folder assets with a file `og-image.jpg` in your
  S3 bucket `bucketName`, then the Key would be: `assets/og-image.jpg`
- **Base64 File:** The Base64 string of the file to upload.

### Generate Public URL

This node makes a file in an S3 bucket publicly accessible and returns its public URL. It is useful when you want to
share files stored in your S3 bucket with external users.

<Image src={aws6} alt='AWS S3 Storage' width={1200} />

Suppose you have media files or documents stored in your S3 bucket that need to be accessed by users outside your
organization. You can use this node to generate public URLs for these files, allowing external users to view or download
them.

**Required Inputs:**

- **Region:** The AWS region to which this client will send requests.
- **Access ID:** Your AWS Access Key ID.
- **Access Secret:** AWS Secret Access Key.
- **Bucket Name:** The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from.
- **File Path:** The path of the file. **Example:** Suppose you have a folder assets with a file `og-image.jpg` in your
  S3 bucket `bucketName`, then the Key would be: `assets/og-image.jpg`

### Generate Signed URL

This node generates a public signed URL for a specific file in an AWS S3 bucket, providing more control over access to
the file. The signed URL allows temporary access to the file with specified validity.

<Image src={aws7} alt='AWS S3 Storage' width={1200} />

You may have files in your S3 bucket that should only be accessible for a limited time or under certain conditions. This
node allows you to generate signed URLs with controlled access, enhancing security and compliance.

**Required Inputs:**

- **Region:** The AWS region to which this client will send requests.
- **Access ID:** Your AWS Access Key ID.
- **Access Secret:** AWS Secret Access Key.
- **Bucket Name:** The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from.
- **File Path:** The path of the file. **Example:** Suppose you have a folder assets with a file `og-image.jpg` in your
  S3 bucket `bucketName`, then the Key would be: `assets/og-image.jpg`
- **Validity:** The time duration for which the signed URL will be valid, in seconds. (Defaults to **7 Days**)

### Zip Folder

This node zips an existing folder in an S3 bucket and returns a download URL for the zip file. It is useful for bundling
multiple files or documents stored in the S3 bucket into a single zip archive.

<Image src={aws8} alt='AWS S3 Storage' width={1200} />

Suppose you have a collection of files or documents stored in a folder within your S3 bucket that you want to share or
distribute as a single package. This node allows you to zip the folder and provide a convenient download link for the
zip file.

**Required Inputs:**

- **Region:** The AWS region to which this client will send requests.
- **Access ID:** Your AWS Access Key ID.
- **Access Secret:** AWS Secret Access Key.
- **Bucket Name:** The name of the Bucket to fetch the file from.
- **Folder Path:** The path of the folder to be zipped. **Example:** Suppose you have a folder assets in your S3 bucket
  `bucketName`, then the Key would be: `assets`
