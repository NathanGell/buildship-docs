# Leonardo AI

With Leonardo AI Nodes in BuildShip, users can integrate the vast capabilities of the Leonardo AI Models and Generative
AI APIs into their workflows. This allows users to create APIs, backend processes, scheduled jobs, and automate everyday
tasks.

Perform tasks such as generate images, improve and generate prompts, upload images, and integrate with other AI models,
APIs, Databases, and Storage.

## Prerequisites âœ…

To use Leonardo AI Nodes in BuildShip, you need to have a Leonardo AI API Key. Follow these steps to obtain your API
key:

- Log in to your [Leonardo.ai](https://leonardo.ai/) account.
- Click **API Access** > **Subscribe to API Plan**.
- After subscribing to a plan, you will be directed to the **API Access Page**.
- Click **Create New Key**.
- Copy the API key value shown and store it in a safe place. You will need to provide this API key when configuring the
  Leonardo AI Nodes in BuildShip.

<Callout>
  **Recommended:** Store your API Keys as Secrets in BuildShip to store them securely, avoid exposing them in your
  workflows, and reuse them across multiple workflows. . Learn more about [setting secrets in BuildShip](/secrets).

### Improve Prompt

The "Improve Prompt" node is used to **enhance the quality and effectiveness of an image generation prompt**. It
leverage the Leonardo AI to analyze and refine the provided prompt, making it more suitable for generating high-quality
images that accurately reflect the intended concept or scene.

<Image src={leonardo1} alt='Improve Prompt' width={1200} />

#### Input

- **API Key**: Your API key for the Leonardo AI. Refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-) section to learn how to
  obtain your API key.
- **Prompt**: The original prompt text that you want to improve. This prompt should describe the desired image or scene
  you want to generate.

#### Output

The node returns a single output, which is a string containing the improved prompt generated by the Leonardo AI.

#### Use Cases

- **Creative Projects**: Enhance prompts for generating visuals for artistic projects, such as digital illustrations,
  concept art, or book covers.
- **Product Design**: Refine prompts to generate high-quality product images for e-commerce websites or marketing
  materials.

### Generate Prompt

The "Generate Prompt" node is designed to **generate a random image generation prompt** using the Leonardo AI. This node
can be useful when you need a starting point or inspiration for creating new visual concepts or scenes.

<Image src={leonardo2} alt='Generate Prompt' width={1200} />

#### Input

- **API Key**: Your API key for the Leonardo AI. Refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-) section to learn how to
  obtain your API key.

#### Output

The node returns a single output, which is a string containing the randomly generated image generation prompt.

#### Use Cases

- **Inspiration and Exploration**: Use the generated prompts as a starting point for exploring new visual concepts,
  styles, or themes.

### Generate Image

The "Generate Image" node is a powerful tool that **allows you to generate images** using the Leonardo AI's advanced
image generation capabilities. This node leverages the **Stable Diffusion model and other state-of-the-art AI
technologies** to create visually stunning and highly detailed images based on the provided prompt and configuration
settings.

<Image src={leonardo3} alt='Generate Image' width={1200} />

#### Input

- **API Key**: Your API key for the Leonardo AI. Refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-) section to learn how to
  obtain your API key.

- **Prompt**: The text prompt describing the desired image or scene you want to generate.

- **Alchemy**: A boolean value indicating whether to enable the Alchemy feature, which enhances the image generation
  process.

- **Height (optional)**: The input height of the generated images, between 32 and 1024, and a multiple of 8. Default is
  `1024`.

- **Width (optional)**: The input width of the generated images, between 32 and 1024, and a multiple of 8. Default is
  `1024`.

- **Model ID (optional)**: The ID of the model to use for image generation. If not provided, uses `sd_version` to
  determine the version of Stable Diffusion to use.

- **Quantity (optional)**: The number of images to generate, between 1 and 8. If the width or height is over `768`, the
  maximum is 4. Default is 1.

- **Preset Style (optional)**: The style to generate images with, such as `ANIME`, `CREATIVE`, `DYNAMIC`, `ENVIRONMENT`,
  `GENERAL`, `ILLUSTRATION`, `PHOTOGRAPHY`, `RAYTRACED`, `RENDER_3D`, `SKETCH_BW`, `SKETCH_COLOR`, or `NONE`.

#### Output

The node returns an object with the following properties:

- `generationId`: The unique ID of the image generation job.
- `apiCreditCost`: The number of API credits consumed for the generation.

### Upload Init Image

The "Upload Init Image" node is designed to facilitate the process of uploading initial images to the Leonardo AI
platform. This node generates a presigned URL, which can be used to upload an image file directly to an S3 bucket. The
uploaded image can then be utilized in various image generation or manipulation tasks within the Leonardo AI ecosystem.

<Callout>
  Refer to the Leonardo AI Guide on how upload an Image using the pre-signed URL,
  [here](https://docs.leonardo.ai/docs/how-to-upload-an-image-using-a-presigned-url).
</Callout>

<Image src={leonardo4} alt='Upload Init Image' width={1200} />

#### Input

- **API Key**: Your API key for the Leonardo AI. Refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-) section to learn how to
  obtain your API key.
- **Extension**: The file extension of the image you want to upload. Supported extensions are png, jpg, jpeg, or webp.

#### Output

The node returns an object with the following properties:

- `id`: The unique identifier for the uploaded image.
- `fields`: The fields associated with the presigned URL, used for uploading the image file.
- `url`: The presigned URL that can be used to upload the image file to the S3 bucket.
- `key`: The key or path where the image file will be stored in the S3 bucket.

#### Use Cases

- **Dataset Preparation**: Upload initial images to the Leonardo AI platform for use in dataset creation, training, or
  other image-related tasks.
