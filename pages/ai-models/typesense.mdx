# TypeSense Search

The TypeSense Integration in BuildShip allows users to leverage TypeSense for their **searching and indexing** needs.
TypeSense is a **fast, scalable, and developer-friendly open-source search engine** for building high-performance search
experiences.

<br />

<Image src={typesenseOG} alt='TypeSense' width={1200} />

With BuildShip's TypeSense Nodes, users **can connect to their TypeSense Cloud deployment or their own TypeSense
instances** (easily modify the node logic according to your requirements) effortlessly. This integration empowers users
to create **APIs, Scheduled Jobs**, and other backend workflows related to search and indexing operations without
extensive coding requirements.

The TypeSense Nodes in BuildShip provide a no-code solution for interacting with TypeSense, enabling users to leverage
its powerful search capabilities within their workflows seamlessly. Whether you need to **index data, perform searches,
or manage collections**, the TypeSense Nodes offer a straightforward and user-friendly approach.

## Prerequisites âœ…

Before you can start using the TypeSense Nodes in BuildShip, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

### TypeSense Instance or TypeSense Cloud Account

You'll need access to a TypeSense instance or a TypeSense Cloud account. If you're using TypeSense Cloud, follow these
steps:

- Go to [TypeSense Cloud](https://cloud.typesense.org) and create an account if you don't have one already.
- Create a new cluster (this process may take 4-6 minutes, after which you'll be able to generate your API keys).
- Click on the "Generate API Keys" button to download a file containing your API keys.

<Image src={typesense1} alt='TypeSense' width={1200} />

### API Keys

Depending on your use case, you'll need to provide different **API keys** for authentication. Refer to the
[TypeSense documentation](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.2/api/api-keys.html#create-an-api-key) to learn more about
which API key to use for different operations.

### Host

The **Node** mentioned on your TypeSense Dashboard is your host. This value will be used as an input to the TypeSense
nodes in BuildShip.

## Create Collection

The "Create Collection" node allows you to create a new collection in your TypeSense instance. A collection is a logical
grouping of documents that share the same schema. You can use this node to create a new collection and define its
schema.

<Image src={typesense2} alt='TypeSense' width={1200} />

### Inputs

- **API Key**: The API key required for authentication with your TypeSense instance. This should be provided as a
  secret.
- **Host**: The host address of your TypeSense instance or cluster.
- **Collection Name**: The name you want to give to the new collection.
- **Schema Fields**: The schema fields for the new collection, provided as a JSON array. Each field should specify a
  name and a type (e.g., string, int32, geopoint, etc.).

**EXAMPLE INPUT**

```json
[
  { "name": "title", "type": "string" },
  { "name": "body", "type": "string" },
  { "name": "author", "type": "string" },
  { "name": "tags", "type": "string[]", "facet": true },
  { "name": "published_at", "type": "int32", "optional": true, "sortable": true }
]
```

<Callout>
  You can use the "Create Collection" node when you need to set up a new collection in your TypeSense instance to store
  and search data. For example, if you're building an application that deals with location-based data, you might create
  a collection called "places" with fields like "title", "points", and "location" (a geopoint type).
</Callout>

### Output

The node returns an object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "collection": {
    "enable_nested_fields": boolean,
    "token_separators": array,
    "num_documents": number,
    "name": string,
    "created_at": number,

    "fields": [
      {
        "name": string,
        "index": boolean,
        "optional": boolean,
        "infix": boolean,
        "sort": boolean,
