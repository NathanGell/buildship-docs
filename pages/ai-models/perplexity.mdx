# Perplexity AI

The BuildShip allows you to leverage the power of Perplexity AI's language models directly within your BuildShip
workflows. Perplexity AI is designed to provide **high-quality, coherent, and contextually relevant responses** by
leveraging cutting-edge **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

BuildShip offers a **pre-built Perplexity AI Node** that simplifies the integration of Perplexity AI's language models
into your workflows.

<Callout type='info'>
  The integration utilizes the Perplexity AI Chat API, which provides access to Perplexity AI's language models. The API
  reference for the Chat API can be found [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/reference/post_chat_completions).

## Prerequisites âœ…

### Perplexity API Key

To use the Perplexity AI nodes, you need a Perplexity API key. Follow the steps below to get your API key:

- Sign up for a Perplexity AI account at [Perplexity AI](https://perplexity.ai/), if you don't already have one.
- Navigate to your account settings. Under the [API Section](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api), register your
  credit card to get started. This step will not charge your credit card. Rather, it stores payment information for
  later API usage.
- Generate an API key. This key will be required for authentication in the Perplexity AI nodes.

  **Recommended:** Save your API Keys securely with [BuildShip Secret Manager](/secrets) to easily reuse them in your
  nodes.

## Node: Perplexity AI

The Perplexity AI Node is a pre-built node that simplifies the integration of Perplexity AI's language models into your
BuildShip workflows. The Perplexity AI Node can be found in the Node Library, under the **Perplexity AI** integration.

The node inputs allows you to specify various configuration parameters to customize the interaction with the Perplexity
AI Chat API. The Perplexity AI Node accepts the following input parameters:

### API Key

Your Perplexity AI API Key, which you can generate through the Perplexity Account Settings Page. Refer to the
[Prerequisites](#prerequisites-) section for more information on obtaining your API Key.

### System Prompt

The system's prompt message, which sets the context or instructions for the AI model.

**Sample System Prompt:**

```
You are a helpful kitchen assistant. You'll be asked to provide recipes for various dishes.
```

### User Input

The user's prompt question or input text. Sample Input:

**Sample User Input:**

```
What is the recipe for a classic Margherita pizza? I have pizza dough, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, garlic cloves, and fresh basil.
```

### Models

The Perplexity AI model to be used for generating the response. You can select from the following options:

- **Mistral 7B Instruct**: A large-scale language model trained on a diverse range of text sources, designed for
  generating instructional text.

- **Mixtral 8X7B Instruct**: A larger-scale language model trained on a diverse range of text sources, designed for
  generating instructional text.

- **Sonar Small Chat**: A smaller-scale language model trained on conversational text, designed for generating chatbot
  responses.

- **Sonar Medium Chat**: A medium-scale language model trained on conversational text, designed for generating chatbot
  responses.

- **Sonar Small Online**: A smaller-scale language model trained on online text, designed for generating online content.

- **Sonar Medium Online**: A medium-scale language model trained on online text, designed for generating online content.

- **CodeLlama 70B Instruct**: A large-scale language model trained on instructional text, designed for generating
  instructional content.

## Output

The Perplexity AI Node directly returns the response generated by the Perplexity AI model based on the user input and
system prompt. The response can be used in subsequent nodes within your workflow for further processing or analysis.

<Callout>
  Connect the output of the Perplexity AI Node to other nodes in your workflow to process the generated response, or
  simply use the [Return Node](/core-nodes/return) and hit the workflow test icon to view the response in your BuildShip
  Canvas itself.
