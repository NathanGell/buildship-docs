Leveraging BuildShip's Supabase Nodes, users can seamlessly connect to their Supabase instances, unlocking the potential
to craft **APIs, Scheduled Jobs, and various backend workflows centered around search and indexing tasks**. This
integration is specially crafted to reduce the need for extensive coding, facilitating straightforward management of
search indices, documents, and configurations within the intuitive BuildShip environment.

The Supabase Nodes provide a no-code interface for engaging with Supabase, ensuring a hassle-free integration of
advanced search features into your projects. From indexing new documents and tweaking search settings to conducting
intricate search queries, Supabase Nodes are designed to streamline these processes in a user-friendly manner.

## Prerequisites âœ…

Before you can start using the Supabase Nodes in BuildShip, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

### Supabase Project

You'll need access to a Supabase project. Follow these steps to prepare your account and initiate your first project:

1. Navigate to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to either sign up for a new account or log in if you are an existing
   user.
2. Create a new project and configure your database as needed.

It's important to note, generating API keys for secure interaction with your Supabase instance is an important step that
follows the establishment of your project.

### API Keys

Supabase utilizes API keys to authenticate, granting complete operational access. For enhanced security, it is
recommended to [generate new API keys](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api) with restricted scopes tailored to specific
use cases.

### Host

The URL of your Supabase instance serves as the host. This critical piece of information is required for connecting
BuildShip's Supabase nodes to your Supabase server. For more details on obtaining your Supabase instance's URL, refer to
the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api).

For comprehensive guidance on setting up the Supabase project, please refer to the
[Supabase Tutorial](https://docs.buildship.com/tutorials/supabase-crud).

For the Full Text Search, Semantic Search, and Hybrid Search nodes, suppose you have a Supabase table called `documents`
with the columns `id`, `title`, `content`, and `created_at`. You can follow along with this guide to try out the nodes.

You can create the documents table with the following SQL code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Full Text Search

The "Full Text Search" node allows you to perform full-text searches on a Supabase table, enabling you to find documents
that match a specific search query.

<Image src={supabase6} alt='Supabase' width={1200} />

### Prerequisites

1. Supabase Project: Ensure you have a Supabase project set up.
2. Table with Data: Ensure your table has data added as described in the
   ["Creating Data"](https://docs.buildship.com/tutorials/supabase-crud#creating-data) section.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Add Full Text Search Column

Add a full-text search (`fts`) column to the table you want to search within. Lets add a `fts` column to the `documents`
table which we have created earlier.

```sql
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN fts TSVECTOR GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('english', content)) STORED;
```

`TSVECTOR` is a PostgreSQL data type used for storing text search vectors, which are optimized representations of text
for full-text search. This specifies that the fts column is a computed column, automatically generated based on the
content of another column (`content` in this case).

2. Create Index

Create an index for the full-text search.

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING gin(fts);
```

This command creates an index on the `fts` column of the `documents` table. It allows fast lookups of documents that
contain specific words or phrases.

{' '}

<Callout>
  Adding a `TSVECTOR` column and creating a `GIN` index significantly enhances the performance of full-text search
  queries by reducing the time and resources needed to find matching documents. By converting the content into a
  TSVECTOR and indexing it, PostgreSQL can quickly identify relevant documents based on the search terms, making
  searches much faster than scanning the entire table.
</Callout>

### Inputs

- **API Key**: The API key required for authentication with your Supabase instance. This should be provided as a secret.
- **API URL**: The host address of your Supabase instance. This can be provided as a secret.
- **Table Name**: The Supabase table name where you want to perform the search.
- **Column Name**: The name of the column in the specified table where the full-text search will be conducted.
- **Query**: The search query string that you want to use for finding matching documents.
- **Match Count**: (Optional) The number of results to return. Default is 10.
- **Search Type**: (Optional) The type of full-text search to perform. (`plain`, `phrase`, and `websearch`)

  <Callout>
    Use the "Full Text Search" node when you need to search for documents in a Supabase table based on a specific query.
    This can be useful in various scenarios, such as implementing search functionality in your application, finding
    relevant data based on user input, or filtering data based on specific criteria.
  </Callout>

### Output

The node returns an object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "results": [
    {
      "row": object
    }
  ]
}
```

- `success` : A boolean value indicating the success of the operation.
- `results` : An array of objects, each representing an object that matched the search query. The row property contains
  the full row data.

## Creating Embeddings

To perform semantic search hybrid search you need to create embeddings for your documents. Vectors in Supabase are
enabled via [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/), a PostgreSQL extension for storing and querying vectors
in Postgres.It can be used to store [embeddings](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/concepts#what-are-embeddings). For
this you have to enable the `vector` extention which will give access to a new data type called `vector`. If you want
more information You can use this
[guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/vector-columns?queryGroups=database-method&database-method=dashboard#enable-the-extension)
to enable the extention. To enable it via sql command you can use below SQL code.

```sql
create extension vector
with
  schema extensions;
```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Add Embedding Column

Add an `embedding` column to the `documents` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN embedding VECTOR(1536);
```

2. Generate Embeddings

- **Generate Embeddings with OpenAI:** Use the Buildship OpenAI Generate Embeddings Node to create embeddings for each
  document's content.
- **Retrieve Table Documents:** Use the Get Columns node to retrieve all the documents from the table with the specified
  columns. In this case, you only need the `id` and `content` of each row.
- **Update Embedding Column:** For each row, update the new embedding column value using the Generate Embeddings node
  and Supabase Update Row node enclosed in a Repeat node.

For a streamlined implementation, you can use this
[Remix template](https://buildship.app/remix/8c31f380-021d-43a4-ad33-7c8d729a1631) as shown in the image below:

<Callout>This step is **necessary** for performing semantic searches and hybrid searches later.</Callout>

## Semantic Search

Semantic search enables you to find documents that match the meaning of a search query. The Supabase "Semantic Search"
node allows you to perform semantic searches on a Supabase table, enabling you to find documents that match the meaning
of a search query.

<Image src={supabase8} alt='Supabase' width={1200} />

### Prerequisites

1. Supabase Project: Ensure you have a Supabase project set up.
2. Table with Data and Embeddings: Ensure your table has data and embeddings added as described above.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create Index

To perform efficient semantic vector searches, you need to create an index on the embedding column in your table. This
index uses the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm, which is suitable for high-dimensional vector data.

Create an index for the semantic vector search:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);
```

2. Semantic Search Function

To perform semantic search, you need to create a SQL function in your Supabase database to match documents based on
embeddings. This function will help you find documents that are semantically similar to the query. It is crucial that
the function is named `semantic_search`, as the node requires this specific name to operate correctly.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION semantic_search (
  query_embedding VECTOR(1536),
  match_threshold FLOAT,
  match_count INT
)
RETURNS SETOF documents
LANGUAGE SQL
AS $$
  SELECT *
  FROM documents
  WHERE documents.embedding <=> query_embedding < 1 - match_threshold
  ORDER BY documents.embedding <=> query_embedding ASC
  LIMIT LEAST(match_count, 200);
$$;
```

<Callout>
  Use the `semantic_search` function to perform semantic search queries. This function compares the embeddings stored in
  the `documents` table with the embedding of the search query, returning documents that are semantically similar.
</Callout>

3. Use the Semantic Search node to perform the search.

### Inputs

- **API Key**: The API key required for authentication with your Supabase instance. This should be provided as a secret.
- **API URL**: The host address of your Supabase instance. This can be provided as a secret.
- **OpenAI Key**: The API key required for authentication with OpenAI. This should be provided as a secret.
- **Open AI Model**: The embedding model to use (e.g., 'text-embedding-ada-002').
- **Query**: The search query string that you want to use for finding matching documents.
- **Match Threshold**: (Optional) The threshold for matching results.
- **Match Count**: (Optional) The number of results to return.

### Output

The node returns an object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "results": [
    {
      "row": object
    }
  ]
}
```

- `success` : A boolean value indicating the success of the operation.
- `results` : An array of objects, each representing an object that matched the search query. The row property contains
  the full row data.

## Hybrid Search

The Hybrid Search feature in Supabase combines traditional keyword search with semantic vector search, enabling you to
find documents that are relevant both textually and semantically.The Supabase "Hybrid Search" node allows you to perform
hybrid searches on a Supabase table, enabling you to find documents that match the meaning of a search query.

<Image src={supabase9} alt='Supabase' width={1200} />

### Prerequisites

1. Supabase Project: Ensure you have a Supabase project set up.
2. Table with Data and Embeddings: Ensure your table has data and embeddings added as described above.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create the `fts` and `embedding` columns for the `documents` table as described in the Full Text Search and Semantic
   Search sections. The table should look as follows:

<Image src={supabase10} alt='Supabase' width={1200} />

2. Hybrid Search Function

Create a function to perform hybrid search: To perform hybrid search, you need to create a SQL function in your Supabase
database to match documents based on embeddings. This function will help you find documents that are semantically
similar to the query. It is crucial that the function is named `hybrid_search`, as the node requires this specific name
to operate correctly.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION hybrid_search(
  QUERY_TEXT TEXT,
  QUERY_EMBEDDING VECTOR(1536),
  MATCH_COUNT INT,
  FULL_TEXT_WEIGHT FLOAT = 1,
  SEMANTIC_WEIGHT FLOAT = 1,
  RRF_K INT = 50
)
RETURNS SETOF documents
LANGUAGE SQL
AS $$
WITH full_text AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ts_rank_cd(fts, websearch_to_tsquery(QUERY_TEXT)) DESC) AS rank_ix
  FROM
    documents
  WHERE
    fts @@ websearch_to_tsquery(QUERY_TEXT)
  ORDER BY rank_ix
  LIMIT LEAST(MATCH_COUNT, 30) * 2
),
semantic AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY embedding <#> QUERY_EMBEDDING) AS rank_ix
  FROM
    documents
  ORDER BY rank_ix
  LIMIT LEAST(MATCH_COUNT, 30) * 2
)
SELECT
  documents.*
FROM
  full_text
  FULL OUTER JOIN semantic
    ON full_text.id = semantic.id
  JOIN documents
    ON COALESCE(full_text.id, semantic.id) = documents.id
ORDER BY
  COALESCE(1.0 / (RRF_K + full_text.rank_ix), 0.0) * FULL_TEXT_WEIGHT +
  COALESCE(1.0 / (RRF_K + semantic.rank_ix), 0.0) * SEMANTIC_WEIGHT
  DESC
LIMIT
  LEAST(MATCH_COUNT, 30)
$$;
```

<Callout>
  Employ the "Hybrid Search" function to enhance search functionality in your applications by delivering results that
  not only match the keywords but also align semantically with the user's intent. This function is particularly
  beneficial in providing more relevant and context-aware search results, thereby improving the user experience.
</Callout>

3. Use the Hybrid Search node to perform the search.

### Inputs

- **API Key**: The API key required for authentication with your Supabase instance. This should be provided as a secret.
- **API URL**: The host address of your Supabase instance. This can be provided as a secret.
- **OpenAI Key**: The API key required for authentication with OpenAI. This should be provided as a secret.
- **Open AI Model**: The embedding model to use (e.g., 'text-embedding-ada-002').
- **Query**: The search query string that you want to use for finding matching documents.
- **Match Count**: The number of results to return.
- **Full Text Weight**: The weight for full-text search component in the hybrid search.
- **Semantic Weight**: The weight for semantic search component in the hybrid search.
- **rrfK**: The K constant for the Relative Ranking Factor (RRF) used in the search.

### Output

The node returns an object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "results": [
    {
      "row": object
    }
  ]
}
```

- `success` : A boolean value indicating the success of the operation.
- `results` : An array of objects, each representing an object that matched the search query. The row property contains
  the full row data.
