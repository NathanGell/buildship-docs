As you build workflows on BuildShip and Deploy 🚀 it on your application and make it accessible on the internet, you're
going to need to secure it too.

## Using Get Authorization Header

<Steps>

### Accessing the API Key and Authorization Header

You can easily **access the user's API key from the Request's Authorization Headers**:

- Click on the **Edit icon (✎)** on the REST API Trigger.
- Add a new input under **Request Headers** - authorization.
- Click on Save.

### Using the Get Authorization Header Node

This validates the presence of the Authorization Header in the incoming request, ensuring the user's API key is included
and verifying it.

- Add the **Get Authorization Header Node** from the Node Explorer next to the REST API Call.
- In the Request, pass the Request of the REST API Call as a variable.

### Adding Condition to Validate Header

We will use Branch Node to add condition to validate and verify the authorization header in the API request.

- In the condition set the condition as `Authorization Header Value == ${APIKey}`, use variable to do this, refer to
  below image.
- Now you can add the nodes of your workflow to then and else condition accordingly.
