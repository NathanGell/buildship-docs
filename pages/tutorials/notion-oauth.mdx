In the realm of productivity tools, Notion stands out as an all-encompassing platform for planning, brainstorming, and
project management.

Leveraging the capabilities of the Notion API, we can now extend its functionality to build automations and workflows
that enhance our productivity.

With the introduction of BuildShip OAuth Notion Nodes, connecting to your Notion workspace and crafting automations
becomes a seamless, no-code experience.

## Prerequisites ✅

### A Notion Account

To get started, you'll need a Notion account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free
[here](https://www.notion.so/signup).

### Page and Database IDs

For some nodes, you'll need to provide the ID of the page or database you want to interact with. You can find the ID of
the Page or Database as shown below:

<Image src={ids} alt='Notion IDs' width={1200} />

## Authenticating Notion OAuth Nodes

Notion OAuth Nodes feature a distinctive Fingerprint Icon initially highlighted in red, indicating a lack of
authentication to any specific account.

<Image src={authentication} alt='Notion Authentication' width={1200} />

Follow the steps below to authenticate:

<Steps>
### Initiating Authentication

- Click on the Fingerprint Icon associated with the Notion OAuth Node.

- This action triggers an authentication window, prompting users to log in to their Notion integration.

### Successful Authentication

- Upon successful login, the Fingerprint Icon turns green, signifying a completed authentication process.

- If the icon doesn't change automatically, users can manually select the authenticated user account by clicking the
  Fingerprint Icon again.

## Notion OAuth Nodes

### Fetch Page

Fetch Page node let's you retrieve a Notion page simply by logging in.

Get the required information from a Notion page to incorporate it into another application or workflow.

<Image src={getPage} alt='Notion Get Page' width={1200} />

<Callout type='tip' emoji='💡'>
  **SAMPLE USE CASE:** Consider a scenario where you have a Notion page containing the latest sales figures. You can use
  the Fetch Page node to extract this data and display it on an external dashboard without manual data entry.
</Callout>

### Create Page

The Create Page creates a new page that is a child of an existing page or database.

<Callout type="tip" emoji="💡">
**SAMPLE USE CASE:** Imagine you have a support ticket system, and each new ticket requires a dedicated Notion page for tracking.

With the Create Page node, you can automatically generate a new Notion page for each incoming support ticket,
streamlining your workflow.

</Callout>

### Update Block

The Update Block function allows you to modify existing content within a specific block in Notion by using the block's
unique identifier (`blockId`). It supports various block types, such as `paragraph`, `heading_1`, `heading_2`, `code`,
and more, each allowing different styles and content formats.

<Callout type="tip" emoji="✍️">
**SAMPLE USE CASE:** Consider a project management scenario where you maintain a Notion page for each project. As the project progresses, you might need to update status reports, task lists, or technical documentation directly within specific blocks on a page.

With the Update Block Node, you can update these sections in real time, ensuring that project documentation remains
current and accessible to all stakeholders.

</Callout>

### List Users

The List Users node returns a list of users that have access to the workspace.

<Callout type='tip' emoji='💡'>
  **SAMPLE USE CASE:** Suppose you are building an internal tool that requires sending notifications to specific users
  in your Notion workspace. The List Users node enables you to fetch the user details dynamically and send targeted
  notifications.
</Callout>

<Image src={listUsers} alt='Notion List Users' width={1200} />

### Query Database

Gets a list of Pages and/or Databases contained in the database, filtered and ordered according to the filter conditions
and sort criteria provided in the request using OAuth.

<Image src={queryDb} alt='Notion Query Database' width={1200} />

### Search by Title

Performs a search on Notion for a given title through all the parent and child pages.

<Callout type='tip' emoji='💡'>
  **SAMPLE USE CASE:** For content creation, you might have various documents scattered across different pages in
  Notion. The Search by Title node allows you to efficiently locate relevant documents by searching for specific titles.
</Callout>

<Image src={search} alt='Notion Query Database' width={1200} />

### Create a Database as a Subpage

Creates a database as a subpage in the specified parent page, with the specified properties schema. Currently, the
parent of a new database must be a Notion page or a wiki database.

<Callout type='tip' emoji='💡'>
  **SAMPLE USE CASE:** For sub-chapters creation, Suppose you are creating a Book on your Database or Notion Page, with
  Create a Database as a Subpage node you can add subchapters to it.
</Callout>
