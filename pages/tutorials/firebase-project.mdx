BuildShip provides pre-defined nodes for Firestore integration, making it easy to interact with Firebase services within your workflows.

BuildShip offers two options for interacting with Firebase:

1. Using BuildShip's built-in Firestore database
2. Connecting to your own Firebase project

## Option 1: Using BuildShip's Built-in Firestore Database

BuildShip comes equipped with a built-in Firestore database that is automatically associated with your BuildShip project.

- **No Additional Setup:** Everything is pre-configured and ready for immediate use.
- **Easy Access:** Users can directly access and interact with the Firestore database through BuildShip.
- **Full Functionality:** You can perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and more, making it a comprehensive solution for your Firebase integration needs.

  Presently, users do not have manual access to the underlying Firestore
  project; however, we have exciting plans to introduce a UI feature that will
  enable this in the near future! 🚀

### Using BuildShip Database nodes

In the Node Explorer, navigate to the "**BuildShip Database**" category. You'll find a range of nodes for various Firestore operations.
Insert the relevant Firestore integration nodes into your workflow. Customize the nodes by providing the necessary input parameters for your specific use case.

> You do not need to provide any additional information, like the `Project ID` parameter to use the BuildShip Database nodes. You can directly use the nodes to interact with your Firestore database.

## Option 2: Connecting to Your Own Firebase Project

Users can connect their Firebase projects by **providing the Project ID** and **setting up permissions for the BuildShip Runtime Service Account**.

Steps to set up your own Firebase Connection:

<Steps>
### Insert any Firebase Integration Node
From the Node Explorer, insert any Firestore integration node into your workflow. Add the required fields to the node and add the Project ID of your Firebase project to which you want to add the data.

### Access BuildShip Settings

Navigate to the **Settings** section, found in the top-left corner of your dashboard, next to the Project Name.

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  **Admin Access Required** You need to be the admin of the BuildShip account to
  access the BuildShip Settings.
</Callout>

Under the **General** tab in BuildShip Settings, you will find information about the **underlying Firebase Project ID** and **Service Account details**. Copy the Service Account details as we need this to grant access to your Firebase project.

### Grant Access in Firebase IAM & Admin

- Open a new browser tab or window and go to your Firebase Project's [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

  <Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
    Make sure you are logged in to the correct Google account that has access to
    the Firebase project you want to connect to BuildShip. Also, make sure
    you've selected the correct Firebase project in the GCP Console.
  </Callout>

- Navigate to the **IAM & Admin** section from the Firebase project's GCP Console.

- Click on the **Grant Access** button to add a new principal.

- **Paste the Service Account details** you copied from BuildShip into the "New Principal" field.

- Assign the role of `Cloud Datastore User` to the Service Account.

- Hit the **Save** button to grant access to the Service Account.

This will allow BuildShip to interact with your Firebase resources.

Once you've added the Project ID in your BuildShip Firebase node, you're good to go! 🚀 You can now use the workflow to interact with your Firebase project's data.

## Purpose and Corresponding Nodes

Here's a comparison table highlighting the purpose of Firestore operations and the corresponding nodes for both BuildShip's Firestore Database and your own Firestore Database:

| Purpose                        | BuildShip Database Nodes   | Firestore Database Nodes       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Create Document**            | Create Document            | Create Firestore Document      |
| **Sync Collection to Algolia** | Sync Collection to Algolia | Sync Firebase to Algolia Index |
| **Add Object to Array**        | Add Object to Array        | Add Object to Firestore Array  |
| **Collection Query**           | Collection Query           | Firestore Collection Query     |
| **Query Count**                | Query Count                | Firestore Query Count          |
| **Delete Document**            | Delete Document            | Delete Firestore Document      |
| **Get Document**               | Get Document               | Get Firestore Document         |
| **Get Field Value**            | Get Field Value            | Get Document Field Value       |
| **Update Field Value**         | Update Field Value         | Update Firestore Field Value   |
