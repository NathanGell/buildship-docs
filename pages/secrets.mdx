# Using Secrets and API Keys

import Image from 'next/image';
import { Steps } from 'nextra/components';
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';
import secrets1 from '/public/dev-tools/secrets-1.png';
import secrets2 from '/public/dev-tools/secrets-2.png';
import secrets3 from '/public/dev-tools/secrets-3.png';
import secrets4 from '/public/dev-tools/secrets-4.png';

Ensuring the security of your applications and workflows is paramount. Hardcoding sensitive information like secret keys
directly into your code can lead to **potential vulnerabilities and increased costs due to unauthorized access**.
BuildShip addresses this concern by providing **an effective way to safeguard your secret keys** using Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) Secret Manager under the hood.

## What is a Secret?

A secret is an global object used within a project that holds sensitive information. This information can include things
like API keys, passwords, certificates, and credentials. Each secret has two main parts:

1. Metadata: This is information about the secret itself, but not the sensitive data. Metadata can list where the secret
   is stored, any labels or notes attached to it (called annotations), and who has the right to access or change it
   (permissions).

2. Secret Versions: These are the actual pieces of sensitive data that you want to keep private. Each version represents
   a separate piece of information or an update to the secret.

## Types of Secrets

1. API Key - An API key is a unique single string of randomly generated characters that is used to authenticate clients
   and grant access to an API.

2. SSH (Secure Shell) - An SSH key is an access credential in the [SSH protocol](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol). Its
   function is similar to that of user names and passwords, but the keys are primarily used for automated processes and
   for implementing single sign-on by system administrators and power users.

3. Encription Key - An encryption key is a string of specifically organized bits designed to unscramble and decipher
   encrypted data.

If the Secret requires a collection of metada then you can also store it as a JSON Object, example: The
[PlayHT](https://play.ht/text-to-speech-api) secret requires a secretKey and userID.

```json
{
  "secretKey": "Paste your secret key",
  "userId": "Paste your userId"
}
```

## How BuildShip stores a secret securely on Google Cloud Secrets Manager?

BuildShip integrates with Google Cloud Secret Manager so you don't have your secrets exposed in your frontend
application and ensures that your keys remain confidential and are only accessed when needed.

<Steps>
### Add Secret Key Input Parameter

- Navigate to the **Node Editor** for a logic node where you intend to use a secret key.
- In the **Params** section, add a new input parameter to receive the Secret Key.
- For example, let's say you want to use the Replicate API Key. Create an input parameter as follows:

  ```js copy
  [
    {
      key: 'apiKey',
      label: 'Replicate API Key',
      description: 'The API Key for Replicate',
      required: false,
      validation: '',
      type: 'string',
    },
  ];
  ```

  or via UI Form:

  {" "}

  <Image src={secrets1} alt='Secret Key Input Parameter' width={1200} />

- Save the input parameter.

### Access Secret Key in Node Logic

- Within the Node Editor, navigate to the **Node Logic** section.
- **Import the input parameters** into your function, for example:
  ```js copy
  export default async function runMusicGenModel({ prompt, apiKey }) {
    // Your code here
  }
  ```
- Use the `apiKey` variable to access the API Key value in your logic:

  ```js copy
  const replicate = new Replicate({
    auth: apiKey,
  });
  ```

  {" "}

  <Image src={secrets2} alt='Access Secret Key in Node Logic' width={1200} />

- Save your changes.

### Add Secret in BuildShip Secret Manager

- Back to your workflow workspace, click on the **Expression Icon** `</>` corresponding to the API Key input in your
  Logic Node.
- Under "**Secrets**," click on "**Add a Secret**". This action opens the BuildShip Secret Manager.
  <Image src={secrets3} alt='Add Secret in BuildShip Secret Manager' width={1200} />
- Inside the BuildShip Secret Manager, you have the ability to add, modify, or delete secret keys.
- Click "**Add a Secret Key**", then provide the "**Secret Name**" and "**Secret Value**" associated with your API Key.
  <Image src={secrets4} alt='Add Secret in BuildShip Secret Manager' width={1200} />
- Click "**Save**" to add the secret key to the BuildShip Secret Manager.

### Select Secret Key in Node Editor

- Back in the Node Editor, within the Secrets section, click "Refresh."
- Select the Secret Key you added from the dropdown menu.

</Steps>

And that's it! ðŸš€ By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate secret keys into your workflows while ensuring
their confidentiality and security through BuildShip's Secret Manager integration.
