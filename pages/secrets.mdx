Ensuring the security of your applications and workflows is paramount. Hardcoding sensitive information like secret keys directly into your code can lead to **potential vulnerabilities and increased costs due to unauthorized access**. BuildShip addresses this concern by providing **an effective way to safeguard your secret keys** using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Secret Manager under the hood.

## Leveraging BuildShip Secret Manager

BuildShip introduces a robust solution to manage your secret keys securely using GCP Secret Manager. This ensures that your keys remain confidential and are only accessed when needed.

Here's how to use the Secret Keys with BuildShip:

<Steps>
### Add Secret Key Input Parameter

- Navigate to the **Node Editor** for a logic node where you intend to use a secret key.
- In the **Params** section, add a new input parameter to receive the Secret Key.
- For example, let's say you want to use the Replicate API Key. Create an input parameter as follows:
    ```js copy
    [
        {
            "key": "apiKey",
            "label": "Replicate API Key",
            "description": "The API Key for Replicate",
            "required": false,
            "validation": "",
            "type": "string"
        }
    ]
    ```
    or via UI Form:
    <Image src={secrets1} alt="Secret Key Input Parameter" width={1200} />

- Save the input parameter.

### Access Secret Key in Node Logic

- Within the Node Editor, navigate to the **Node Logic** section.
- **Import the input parameters** into your function, for example:
    ```js copy
    export default async function runMusicGenModel({ prompt, apiKey }) {
        // Your code here
    }
    ```
- Use the `apiKey` variable to access the API Key value in your logic:
    ```js copy
    const replicate = new Replicate({
        auth: apiKey,
    });
    ```
    <Image src={secrets2} alt="Access Secret Key in Node Logic" width={1200} />

- Save your changes.

### Add Secret in BuildShip Secret Manager
- Back to your workflow workspace, click on the **Expression Icon** `</>` corresponding to the API Key input in your Logic Node.
- Under "**Secrets**," click on "**Add a Secret**". This action opens the BuildShip Secret Manager.

- Inside the BuildShip Secret Manager, you have the ability to add, modify, or delete secret keys.
- Click "**Add a Secret Key**", then provide the "**Secret Name**" and "**Secret Value**" associated with your API Key.

- Click "**Save**" to add the secret key to the BuildShip Secret Manager.

### Select Secret Key in Node Editor
- Back in the Node Editor, within the Secrets section, click "Refresh."
- Select the Secret Key you added from the dropdown menu.
