Extract data from web pages by scraping their content.

## Using the Scrape Web URL Node

The Scrape Web URL node's functionality includes fetching the content of a web page for the provided url, the node
accepts below parameters:

- **URL (required)**: The URL of the page you want to scrape. Example: https://docs.buildship.com.

- **Selector (optional)**: Specific HTML selector you want to extract text content from (by default body will be used).

- **Steps (optional)**: List of steps to follow after loading the page in given url.

  **Usage Example:** Suppose you want to scrape the below information:

  {' '}

  <Image src={buildshipGoogleSearch} alt='Buildship google search' width={800} />

  So, the `steps` input value would look something like below:

  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://www.google.com/",
    "selector": "#result-stats",
    "steps": [
      // type "buildship" in google search input box
      {
        "action": "type",
        "params": ["#APjFqb", "buildship"]
      },

      // click on google search button
      {
        "action": "click",
        "params": [".gNO89b"]
      },

      // wait for searched query to load and if page doesn't load within 3 seconds, move to next step
      {
        "action": "waitForNavigation",
        "params": [
          {
            "timeout": 3000,
            "waitUntil": "load"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  The root `selector` value is the selector from which you want to extract the text-content, after all steps are
  executed.

  Each step object in `steps` list consists of `action` and `params`.

  The `action` parameter is the name of any method from
  [puppeteer-page-methods](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page#methods) list. And, the `params` is list of parameters
  required in the selected `action` (a puppeteer method name).

  For one of the `action` - `type`, the parameters for the
  [puppeteer-type-method](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page.type) are:

  <Image src={puppeteerTypeMethodParams} alt='Puppeteer type method parameters' width={800} height={400} />

  Hence, the step object for `type` action would look like:

  ```json
  {
    // puppeteer method name
    "action": "type",

    // "#APjFqb" is the "selector" (the selector to find <input>)
    // "buildship" is the "text" (the value to be typed in <input>)
    // As per parameters list of "type" method, the third parameter is optional,
    // hence we can either include or exclude it from "params" list
    "params": ["#APjFqb", "buildship"]
  }
  ```
