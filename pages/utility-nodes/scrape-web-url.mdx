Extract data from static web pages by scraping their text content. This node works great for less dynamic sites that
don't rely on javascript to load.

## Using the Scrape Web URL Node

The Scrape Web URL node's functionality includes fetching the content of a web page for the provided url, the node
accepts these parameters:

- **URL (required)**: The URL of the page you want to scrape. Example: https://docs.buildship.com.

- **Selector (optional)**: Specific HTML selector you want to extract text content from (by default body will be used).

  **Usage Example:** Suppose you want to scrape https://buildship.com:

  {' '}

  <Image src={buildshipLanding} alt='Buildship landing page' width={800} />

Running the node with the url `https://buildship.com` and selector `body` will return the entire text content of the
page.

{' '}

<Image src={scrapeResult} alt='Buildship landing page' width={800} />
