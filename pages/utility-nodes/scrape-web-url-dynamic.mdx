Extract data from web pages by scraping their text content. This node works great for dynamic and complex sites that
rely on javascript to load.

## Using the Scrape Web URL Node (Dynamic)

The Scrape Web URL node's functionality includes fetching the content of a web page for the provided url. Under the
hood, it uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to scrape the web page thus allowing for more dynamic scraping. The node
accepts these parameters:

- **URL (required)**: The URL of the page you want to scrape. Example: https://docs.buildship.com.

- **Selector (optional)**: Specific HTML selector you want to extract text content from (by default body will be used).

- **Steps (optional)**: List of steps to follow after loading the page in given url.

  **Usage Example:** Suppose you want to scrape the below information:

  {' '}

  <Image src={buildshipGoogleSearch} alt='Buildship google search' width={800} />

To begin we can setup the node, set the URL to `https://www.google.com/` and the selector to `#result-stats`. This will
extract the text content of the search result stats. The `steps` parameter can be used to interact with the page before
extracting the text content.

{' '}

{' '}

<Image src={dynamicScrape} alt='Buildship google search' width={800} />

So, the `steps` input value would look something like below:

```json
[
  // type "buildship" in google search input box
  {
    "action": "type",
    "params": ["#APjFqb", "buildship"]
  },

  // click on google search button
  {
    "action": "click",
    "params": [".gNO89b"]
  },

  // wait for searched query to load and if page doesn't load within 3 seconds, move to next step
  {
    "action": "waitForNavigation",
    "params": [
      {
        "timeout": 3000,
        "waitUntil": "load"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

And after execution we get the information we're looking for:

{' '}

<Image src={dynamicScrapeResult} alt='Buildship google search' width={800} />

The root `selector` value is the selector from which you want to extract the text-content, after all steps are executed.

Each step object in `steps` list consists of `action` and `params`.

The `action` parameter is the name of any method from
[puppeteer-page-methods](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page#methods) list. And, the `params` is list of parameters
required in the selected `action` (a puppeteer method name).

For one of the `action` - `type`, the parameters for the
[puppeteer-type-method](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page.type) are:

{' '}

<Image src={puppeteerTypeMethodParams} alt='Puppeteer type method parameters' width={800} height={400} />

Hence, the step object for `type` action would look like:

```json
{
  // puppeteer method name
  "action": "type",

  // "#APjFqb" is the "selector" (the selector to find <input>)
  // "buildship" is the "text" (the value to be typed in <input>)
  // As per parameters list of "type" method, the third parameter is optional,
  // hence we can either include or exclude it from "params" list
  "params": ["#APjFqb", "buildship"]
}
```
